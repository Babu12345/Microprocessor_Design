How to use the C++ program! Article.cpp file to break down the articles documents.
The code essentially parses the file given in the string 'dir' then you can iterate over the words
in a specific section. The 'text' function takes in the arguments of the specific file name,
the type of information requested (usually 0 - what ever number it ends at but it should stop with the
'imgaltext' section), and the last argument where the information is stored - usually in an array.
This function might need to be converted to C programming in order to use it for embedded systems.

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 
    
   
     vector <string>article;
     
     string dir="/Users/babu_wanyeki/Desktop/Projects/S.I.M.O.N PROJECT/SOFTWARE/ABSTRACTION/XPRESS FILES/articles/";
     dir=dir+"10.xml";
 
    

    text(dir,0,article);
    for(int y=0;y<article.size();y++){
        cout<<article[y]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl<<"Finished"<<endl;
    
return 0;
}
