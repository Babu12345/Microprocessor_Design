  <abstract>An attack on India by terrorists based in Pakistan could lead to the unthinkable, as retaliation by India probably would escalate into a nuclear response by Pakistan.</abstract>
  <text>The most worrisome possibility of a nuclear war lies on the Indian subcontinent, according to the former commander of the U.S. Pacific Command. Adm. Timothy J. Keating, USN (Ret.), told the audience at the opening keynote address for TechNet Asia-Pacific 2011 in Honolulu, Hawaii, that another terrorist attack in India could be the catalyst for an escalating conflict that leads to a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan. Adm. Keating offered that a Mumbai-type attack that leaves hundreds dead almost certainly would trigger a military response from India. If terrorists based in Pakistan are "irrefutably" identified as the architects of the attack, then India could not sit by without responding. A series of Indian air strikes into Pakistan territory in turn would provoke a counter-response from Pakistan, leading to more action by India. With the scales tipping toward India after each exchange, Pakistan might resort to a nuclear strike as its only remaining option. This challenge "keeps me awake at night," the admiral said in describing it as being at the top of his list of regional security concerns.</text>
