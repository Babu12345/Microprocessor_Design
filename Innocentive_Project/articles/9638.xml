  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors, Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded a $10,415,473 cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-reimbursable contract modification for engineering services and associated support efforts for U.S. Navy submarine integrated submarine imaging systems (ISIS). ISIS provides mission-critical, all-weather, visual and electronic search, digital-image management, indication, warning, and platform architecture interface capabilities for Los Angeles-class, Seawolf-class, Ohio-class and Virginia-class submarines with potential for Trident-class and other submarines. ISIS rolls-up existing components and near-term capabilities; and provides a robust architecture for efficiently inserting future capabilities, including items leveraged from Virginia-class photonics program. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington DC, is the contracting activity.</text>
