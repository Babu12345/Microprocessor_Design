  <text>Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is being awarded an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for a maximum of $30 million for Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines (VAATE). The VAATE Phase II and III programs develop revolutionary and innovative technology by the 2017 time frame that will provide a 10X increase in turbo-propulsion affordable capability when carped to a year 2000 state-of-the-art baseline engine. To achieve this goal, the Air Force Research Laboratory's Propulsion Directorate has committed resources to the development of an advanced technology base for aero-thermodynamics and innovative structures, the development of advanced components and the assessment and verification of these components in TRL-6 demonstrator engines. </text>
