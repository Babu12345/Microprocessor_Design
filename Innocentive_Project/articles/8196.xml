  <text>D and S Consultants Incorporated, Eatontown, New Jersey, is being awarded just over $7 million for perceptual training systems and tools. The company will conduct applied research and advanced technology development based on requirements and design recommendations for adapting or developing technologies to create a prototype for users that can improve the training of combat hunter-like knowledge, skills and abilities. Specifically these tools will be evaluated for use as performance assessment and training tools to support enhanced observation, combat trafficking (i.e., observing the physical terrain), and tactical profiling (i.e., observing the human terrain). The result will enhance the warfighter's ability to perceive, observe, collect, and share critical information on people, places and insurgent activity to improve situational awareness, and to facilitate collaboration and information analysis. The Office of Naval Research, Arlington, Virginia, is the contracting activity.</text>
