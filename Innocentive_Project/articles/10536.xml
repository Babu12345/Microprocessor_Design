  <text>Do you ever find yourself jotting down quick calculations on a piece of scrap paper or the back of an envelope? The Soulver app for iOS devices gives you a new way to crunch numbers on the go.
	The program, developed by Acqualia, lets you do quick calculations without needing a traditional calculator. With the app, you simply type out your problem and see the answer as you write. You can use words alongside the numbers to make sense of specific scenarios.
	In short, you can work with numbers the way you think them. For example, type in a problem like: This year my electric bill is $620 - 10% discount. Soulver will produce the answer as you go.
	In addition to instant calculations as you type, the app provides a large keyboard designed for quick math; currrency conversions; easy percentages; all standard math functions; and the ability to save your work, sync it to your computer, share files or send data as emails.
	Purchase the app for $2.99 from the iTunes App Store for the iPhone or the iPad.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
