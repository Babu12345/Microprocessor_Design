  <text>A new iPhone app attracting close to 80,000 new users each day taps into a huge collection of live police, firefighter, aircraft, railroad, marine, emergency and ham radios. Developed by Smartest Apple, the 5-0 Radio app allows users to find feeds in their area and listen while they run other apps or browse the Web. The app has an integrated map that finds the user's location and the feeds associated with that area. It organizes feeds by county, city, country and popularity, among others. The delay between the real radio feed and the app is between 1-3 seconds. New feeds are added each day and a complete list is available at http://smartestapple.com/feeds. The 5-0 Radio Lite app is free, and the 5-0 Radio PRO app is available for $1.99 and adds 33,000 additional feeds. Interested users can follow @50radio on Twitter for the latest information. While Smartest Apple says it is legal in most countries to listen to police feeds, there could be local laws that apply when using feeds outside a user's home, so anyone interested should check before listening.
