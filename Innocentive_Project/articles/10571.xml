  <text>Flu season is in full swing, and the minute the symptoms hit, many of us hop online to check out the latest information. Now, an interactive app goes one step further, providing health news and access to medical professionals right on your iPhone.
	The Urgent Care app by GreatCall Incorporated lets users check their symptoms, peruse a consumer-friendly medical dictionary and even contact a registered nurse for advice at any time, day or night.
	While the app itself is free, contacting a nurse will cost $3.99 per call; if needed, a doctor will call back within 30 minutes.
	Services are available in both English and Spanish.
	Anyone with a medical emergency should immediately seek help or medical attention; however, this app can provide fast resources for anyone with non-urgent symptoms or questions about their health.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store. The Android version is expected later this month.Would you use an app to seek out information about your symptoms?
