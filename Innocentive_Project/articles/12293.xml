  <text>The U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth approximately $8 million to provide an air and missile defense planner that will be integrated into the U.S. Air Force Air Operations Center (AOC), the company recently announced. Lockheed Martinâ€™s planner will link dissimilar weapon and sensor data with map-based planning tools and decision aids that will allow AOC operators to collaboratively plan missions with greater speed and higher confidence. By integrating the missile defense data sources on to a common visualization platform, operators can easily generate and publish planning tactical operations documents to support creation of an area air defense plan. In addition, the planner incorporates an open, non-proprietary software infrastructure that will allow the Air Force to rapidly introduce new capabilities. This open architecture also facilities integration with legacy systems and ultimately helps lower total ownership costs. </text>
