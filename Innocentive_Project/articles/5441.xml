  <text>A key regional ally, Japan possesses one of the region's largest and most technologically advanced navies. The island nation also began a shift in its defense policy when it converted its Defense Agency into a Ministry of Defense in January 2007. The ministry's English language home page provides visitors with links to documents outlining Japanese defense policy and defense program guidelines. The home page lists recent news releases and features links to Japan's joint staff and its ground, maritime and air self-defense forces. Issues of the Japan Defense Focus, the ministry's quarterly publication, can also be accessed from the site.
