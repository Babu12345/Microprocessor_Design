  <text>Alion Science and Technology, McLean, Virginia was recently awarded a more than $4 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to evaluate a revolutionary technology that will enable troops deployed around the world to improve how they record and analyze information obtained while on patrol. Alion will provide performance evaluations on the Graph Understanding and Analysis for Rapid Detection-Deployed On the Ground (GUARD DOG) program, which is designed to assist patrollers as they conduct counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism and counter-drug missions. The work includes experimental designs, test plans, data collection instruments and software, virtual simulations, training scenarios, evaluation results and analysis briefings for major test events.</text>
