  <text>Verizon Business will provide a range of local voice and data services to federal agencies in five mid-Atlantic states under a new agreement, valued at as much as $121 million, with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). Under the contract, the GSA and other federal agencies in the mid-Atlantic region, which covers Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia, can immediately buy local voice and data services, including Centrex, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services, network-based voice messaging, private line data services and related managed and professional services. </text>
