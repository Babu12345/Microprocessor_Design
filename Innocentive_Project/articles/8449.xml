  <text>In the midst of a global cyberspace crisis, the U.S. Defense Department faces many hurdles in its effort to protect and defend government computer networks. According to an unclassified version of a previously issued classified report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), several cyberspace capability gaps exist. The U.S. Cyber Command is decentralized and spread across various offices, commands, and military services and agencies, which makes the supporting relationships necessary to achieve command and control of cyberspace operations unclear. In response to a major computer infection, the U.S. Strategic Command identified confusion regarding authorities and chains of command. Moving forward, the GAO recommended clarifying these relationships and establishing a timeframe for this guidance. Among other proposals, the GAO called for a single joint publication to address cyberspace operations. The Defense Department agreed with the recommendations.</text>
