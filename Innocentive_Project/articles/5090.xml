  <text>SELEX Galileo has awarded DRS Technologies an $11.4 million follow-on contract to produce Fine Track Sensor kits, which are used in Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) transmitters. The transmitters are a key component of Northrop Grumman's Nemesis DIRCM system, which is used to protect rotary- and fixed-wing military aircraft from shoulder-launched, heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles. The work will be performed by the DRS Sensors and Targeting Systems--Infrared Technologies Division in Dallas, Texas.</text>
