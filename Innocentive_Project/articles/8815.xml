  <text>This year, there's no reason to throw away leftover Halloween candy or eat it until your teeth rot. Instead, donate it to Treats 4 Our Troops and the organization will ship it to deployed warfighters. Locations around the Northern Virginia area will collect the sweets for delivery to and pick-up by the nonprofit. Groups outside of that geographic location who wish to participate can contact Treats 4 Our Troops for addresses so they can send their packages directly overseas. On Veterans Day (Friday, November 11), the organization is asking for volunteers to stuff boxes for mailing.Â  Any deployed service members who would like to receive a package can request to be added to the recipient list.

Don't worry about any 2010 dates mentioned on the website. The groups is actively working this year and the latest information including drop-off locations and frequently asked questions can be found on the Treats 4 Our Troops Facebook page. Questions and comments also can be emailed to y.roggen@treats4ourtroops.org.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
