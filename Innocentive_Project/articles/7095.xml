  <text>Blue Star Families and the National Endowment for the Arts have partnered to create the Blue Star Museums, a group of 750 museums in all 50 states that offer free admission to military personnel and their families through Labor Day, September 6, 2010. The program is available to bearers of a Geneva ConventionsÂ common access card, a DD Form 1173 identification card or a DD form 1173-1 identification card, and five immediate family members. On the website, an interactive map of the United States enables users to click specific states to find participating museums and links to their sites. People who take advantage of the free admission are encouraged to share their experiences on the Blue Star Museums Blog. Homefront Help has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
