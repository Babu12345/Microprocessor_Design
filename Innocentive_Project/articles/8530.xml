  <text>FLIR Systems Incorporated, Wilsonville, Oregon, is being awarded a more than $9 million firm-fixed-price, basic ordering agreement for gyro-stabilized long-range thermal imaging sensor systems and pan-and-tilt long-range thermal imaging sensor systems, spare parts, upgrades and repairs in support of the Ground Based Operations Surveillance System. The gyro-stabilized long-range thermal imaging sensor system is a long-range, zoom, color charged-coupled device, daylight camera and thermal mid-wave infrared imager, multi-sensor target acquisition, laser range finder, digital magnetic compass and target geo-location device stabilized gimbal assembly. The pan-and-tilt long-range thermal imaging sensor system is a long-range, large format, zoom, color CCD daylight camera and thermal infrared imager, mapping software and laser range finder capable of establishing target geo-location mounted on a pan-tilt assembly. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Crane, Indiana, is the
contracting activity.</text>
