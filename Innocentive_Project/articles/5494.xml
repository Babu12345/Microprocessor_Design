  <text>Honor Flight Chicago is a little different from most veteran support organizations, and it proves there is no end to the ways people can make a difference in the lives of those who served. The program flies World War II veterans from Chicago Midway Airport to Dulles International Airport and then takes them by bus to see the World War II Memorial erected in Washington, D.C., in their honor. After spending two hours there and eating a box lunch, the group continues to the Korean and Vietnam war memorials and the Iwo Jima Memorial. If time allows, veterans receive a tour of Washington as well. Everyone flies home later the same day. "Guardians"-who make the trip at their own expense-accompany each tour to assist the group during the trips.

The 2008 flights are filled, but the 2009 schedule will be posted on the Web site soon. An application that can be faxed or mailed to Honor Flight Chicago is available online. Information about volunteering and donating also is posted on the site.
