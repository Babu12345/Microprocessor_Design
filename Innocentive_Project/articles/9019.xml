  <text>Raytheon Company, El Segundo, California, is being awarded an $11 million cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for robust navigation technology supporting anti-jam Global Positioning System (GPS) development for the High Velocity Penetrating Weapon Program. The objective of this program is to study, investigate, simulate, develop, design, build, and demonstrate technologies capable of operating in a GPS degraded environment. This effort shall provide enough design flexibility to allow for integration with other advanced technologies to help maintain position, navigation, and timing when GPS is denied. U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, is the contracting activity.</text>
