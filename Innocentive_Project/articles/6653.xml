  <abstract>SIGNAL welcomes Dr. Linton Wells II as the new Incoming columnist.</abstract>
  <text>A new year brings changes afoot, including a new columnist for "Incoming." Robert K. Ackerman, SIGNAL's editor in chief, notes:

We say goodbye to Christopher Dorobek, who offered timely commentary in the Incoming column during the major period of change that accompanied the arrival of the Barack Obama administration. Our new contributing columnist is Dr. Linton Wells II, the transformation chair at National Defense University. Many may remember Lin as the former principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for networks and information integration, but he comes to SIGNAL with other far-ranging experience in many areas. He is still on top of information, and he hits the ground running with his debut column. 

Next up: Wells' first column!
