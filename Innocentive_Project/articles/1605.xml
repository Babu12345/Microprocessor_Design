  <text>Information professionals from all over Europe are gathering on June 4 at the SHAPE Club in Mons, Belgium, to learn and share their ideas about the pitfalls and benefits of using commercial technology in the battlespace. Sponsored by AFCEA Europe, “The Dual Use of Technology” symposium and exposition features a variety of speakers from industry, government and the military. Topics will be discussed from two angles: national and commercial. Featured speakers such as Dag Wilhelmsen, general manager, NATO C3 Agency; Lt. Gen. Ulrich Wolf, DEU  A, director, NCSA; and Tom Conte from Dell Incorporated will offer their insights about topics such as current and emerging technologies, reasons the military has turned to the commercial sector, and how industry is adopting their on-the-shelf products to meet the specific needs of the military.Following the event in Mons, AFCEA Professional Development Europe is offering a two-day course titled “Doing Business with NATO–Understanding the System” on June 5 -6 at the Courtyard Marriott Hotel, Brussels, Belgium. Based on his work with NATO, John Roberts, retired British Army colonel, will lead this workshop-style class that focuses on sharing experiences about working with NATO and offers the opportunity to network with potential collaborators on future projects. </text>
