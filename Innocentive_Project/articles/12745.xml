  <text>Boeing has received its first production order for the Ship’s Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) Modifications program from the U.S. Navy, as well as a fifth order for SSEE Increment F systems, six for the U.S. Navy and four that will support the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy. The modifications will advance maritime forces’ ability to detect, geolocate and exploit signals sent by potential threats on selected SSEE Increment E and F systems. The fifth order for the current system will bring SSEE's real-time capabilities to a U.S. ally for the first time.  </text>
