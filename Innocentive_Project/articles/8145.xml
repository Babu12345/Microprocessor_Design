  <text>This free iPhone app helps you squeeze more out of your data plan and shrink your bills. Save up to 80 percent, understand your data usage, see how much each app requires and get more connectivity at no extra cost.

Described as a "must-have app" by TechCrunch.com, the Onavo app uses compression technology to route data through cloud servers and compress it before it reaches the device or carrier. The app, developed by Onavo Mobile Limited, is ideal for travelers using expensive data plans on business or personal trips. 

Once you install the app, it runs in the background of the phone. It compresses data usage from apps so you get more for your money, which can double or even triple your data plan. 

The app is free for a limited time in the iTunes App Store, but it may switch to a subscription model at a later date.
