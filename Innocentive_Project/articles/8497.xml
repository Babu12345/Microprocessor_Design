  <text>The Veteran Artist Program aids artists who served their country in the military promote their works and careers in the mainstream arts world. Help is offered through networking, mentorship, and collaboration with professional artists and original productions. Creators in all artistic disciplines are invited to be part of the group, which emphasizes bringing together the veteran and artistic communities. The group promotes various events and shows in which veterans can participate.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
