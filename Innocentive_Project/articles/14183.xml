  <text>Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio, has been awarded a $14,000,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for research and development. The Sensor and Information Research Center for Understanding Systems program will carry out fundamental research in sensing and sensor exploitation technologies. These projects will span several disciplines in engineering, science, computer science and mathematics. This program will be made up of multiple short-term projects running simultaneously and addressing several technical topics areas. The objective is to have researchers working on innovative ground-breaking solutions for fundamental research projects that address some of the most difficult sensor challenges and to find technology breakthroughs that will advance the range of technology represented within the Air Force Research Laboratory. Work will be performed at Dayton, Ohio, and is expected to be complete by February 28, 2022. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with nine offers received. Fiscal year 2015 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $324,000 are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-15-D-1845).</text>
