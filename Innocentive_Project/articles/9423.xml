  <text>According to a new report, iPad users shell out a total of nearly $70,000 each day on magazines and newspapers for their tablets. But reading the news isn't the only option for people who want to stay in the loop. The free Newsy app for iPad features 2-3 minute video presentations that summarize and analyze current events by drawing from multiple sources.

The app weaves together content from different external news sources, from large media companies to small blogs, to provide a wider view of stories. Rather than simple aggregating content, the program aims to analyze it. 

Users can pull interesting stories into a playlist; read the transcript of a video; see a list of the sources used; share stories through social media; and post comments. In addition, the app breaks news items into categories: All, World, U.S., Politics, Business, Entertainment, Tech/Science and Environment.

Download the free app from the iTunes App Store.
