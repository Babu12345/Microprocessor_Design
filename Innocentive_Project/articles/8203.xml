  <text>This North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (NARHA) program offers different types of assistance and therapy to veterans through equine activities. Various NARHA centers across the country participate, each with its own set of help capabilities. Conditions that can be alleviated through the horse activities include traumatic brain injuries and amputations-common afflictions for those wounded in combat. The effort connects the centers with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' medical centers and clinics and well as with individuals.

Veterans who would like to participate can use the Find a Center search tool to locate facilities close to them or facilities that offer certain activities or serve specific disabilities. Horses for Heroes accepts contributions to help further fund and develop the program. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
