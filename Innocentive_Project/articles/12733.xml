  <text>High school students and teachers get to learn about the world of cybersecurity through Sandia National Laboratories' Cyber Technologies Academy (CTA), which offers free classes for those interested in computer science and cybersecurity.
	The goal is to take motivated students—even those with no computer experience—to a higher level of cyber proficiency during high school. The classes combine instruction with hands-on learning, giving students an actual cyber environment in which to network and program. High schools are not well-equipped to teach cybersecurity, say Sandia National Laboratory officials. Most schools only offer basic computer science classes, and it is rare to find a high school teacher with a computer science background. Furthermore, high school computer labs typically are not set up to run multiple operating systems and allow students to experience networking.
	Because there is a limit to how many students can be taught directly, the academy is broadening the courses to include teachers as well. The academy will begin taking applications for the summer program in mid-May. The application and other details can be found at the CTA website. Selection is based on student motivation.</text>
