  <text>Achieving health and fitness goals can be tough, particularly in a busy workplace. But the Keas corporate wellness program makes getting healthy fun, social and mobile.
	Through the service, employees form small teams of up to six people with similar health-related goals, and they collaborate to achieve them—working together, motivating one another and earning virtual points in the process. These points can translate into real prizes from the employer. For example, an HR department could use the program to create a goal related to the flu shot and offer rewards to those who participate.
	Now, Keas is available to customers through a free iPhone app, making it easier to track fitness and dietary goals on the go. Mobile features include an interactive news feed, quizzes, and the ability to post photos and status updates.
	Keas integrates with other popular fitness and health trackers, including Fitbit, Runkeeper and GAIN Fitness.
	For more information, visit keas.com. Current Keas users can download the companion app from the iTunes App Store.If your workplace offered a program like Keas, would you participate?These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
