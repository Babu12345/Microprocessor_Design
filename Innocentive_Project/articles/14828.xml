  <text>The Boeing Co., St. Louis, Missouri, is being awarded $14,689,239 for cost-plus-incentive-fee delivery order 0387 against a previously issued basic ordering agreement (N00019-11-G-0001) for the multi-module redesign of the array drive and beam steering controller for the AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array radio detection and ranging to mitigate obsolescence for the Navy and the government of Australia. Work will be performed in Andover, Massachusetts (40 percent); Forest, Mississippi (30 percent); El Segundo, California (20 percent); and St. Louis, Missouri (10 percent), and is expected to be completed in July 2018. Fiscal 2014 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds and foreign military sales funds in the amount $14,689,239 will be obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract combines purchases for the Navy ($12,976,014, 88.4 percent) and the government of Australia ($1,713,225, 11.6 percent) under the Foreign Military Sales program. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.
