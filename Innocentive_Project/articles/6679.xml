  <text>The name says it all. This organization connects Americans with deployed military members, enabling participants to choose their level of involvement, from writing letters to sending entire care packages. Each adopted warfighter is assigned several sponsors so the flow of support never ceases. Troops can register to be adopted, and the public can sign up to adopt a service member on the organization's Web site. Individuals and groups can adopt more than one soldier. The Web site also includes an online community and lists of how to donate and what to donate. For people who want to provide money but not actually adopt a service member, instructions are available online as well. For more Homefront Help items, check out this month's SIGNAL Connections. The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
