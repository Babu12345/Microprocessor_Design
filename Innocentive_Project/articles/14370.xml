  <text>L-3 KEO, Northampton, Massachusetts, is being awarded an $111,794,194 cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price-incentive-fee, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-only and firm-fixed-price contract for the development, first article, production and support of the Low Profile Photonics Mast (LPPM). The LPPM is a modular non hull-penetrating imaging sensor sited in a telescoping universal modular mast bay that provides submarines with improvements in stealth and survivability. Features include short wave infrared and high definition visual imaging, laser range finding, special stealth features and a capable antenna suite with broad spectral coverage and direction finding. This contract includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $157 million. Work will be performed in Northampton, Massachusetts (92 percent); and Newington, Virginia (8 percent), and is expected to be completed by December 2018. Fiscal 2015 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy), fiscal 2015 other procurement (Navy) and fiscal 2015 research, development, test and evaluation funding in the amount of $48,693,558 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured on the basis of full and open competition via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with two offers received. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity (N00024-15-C-6250).</text>
