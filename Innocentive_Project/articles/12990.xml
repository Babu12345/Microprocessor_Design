  <text>Exelis Incorporated Radar, Reconnaissance and Acoustic Systems, Van Nuys, California, has been awarded a $9,647,241 firm-fixed- price contract for a Ground Control Approach System (GCA). This effort is a new program in support of a foreign military sales case for the Saudi Arabian National Guard. This action will provide a GCA for installation at a Khasham Al An Airbase. The GCA system will be utilized for aircraft approach and landing guidance, including airspace control services in support of air traffic control operations and Saudi Arabian National Guard aviation mission requirements. Work will be performed in Saudi Arabia, and is expected to be completed by June 10, 2024. This award is the result of a sole-source acquisition. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, is the contracting activity (FA8730-14-C-0008).</text>
