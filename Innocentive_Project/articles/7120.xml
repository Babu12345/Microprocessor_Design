  <text>The U.S. Defense Department's hub for all things social media has undergone a serious facelift, complete with tips, tricks and lessons on how to share information responsibly and effectively.

The Social Media Hub was redesigned to help members of the Defense Department community understand what constitutes proper use of Internet-based capabilities. The new site contains learning resources, detailed department policies and procedures, and social media guides for each military service branch.

What used to be a portal for the department's social media outlets will now be "more than just a website advertising DoD's latest Facebook posts or Twitter feed," says Joelle Zarcone, public affairs specialist, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. The department compiled a variety of resources for users into one online toolbox, which includes how to voice social media questions and stay up-to-date on related news.

The website is also beneficial for those outside the department, because it provides interactive games and demonstrations to drive home the message about safety and security while social networking.

Check out the site and see what else it has to offer. The Defense Department's list of registered social media sites for the department and each service is still available for those who are interested.</text>
