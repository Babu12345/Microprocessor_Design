  <text>TeleCommunication Systems Incorporated (TCS) has received an additional $7 million contract from the U.S. Marine Corps for 43 wireless point-to-point link (WPPL) systems for deployed troops overseas. The TCS WPPL systems provide deployed Marines with point-to-point and point-to-multipoint secure transmission of voice, video and data communications over terrestrial microwave radio links. WPPL allows end users flexibility when determining the scope of local area network (LAN) communications.</text>
