  <text>The U.S. Army is establishing an Electronic Warfare (EW) 29-series career field for officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel that will cover topics ranging from information operations to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Approximately 1,600 EW personnel will be added to the Army during the next three years. The service is considering expanding the career field by as many as 2,300 in the near future.

Personnel in this career field will be considered experts in fighting the threat of IEDs. In addition, they will guide commanders in the effects of the electromagnetic spectrum on operations as well as counsel them about how friendly EW can support tactical and operational objectives. 

Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, USA, former commander of Multinational Corps-Iraq, identified the urgent need for EW specialists and capability in 2006 when he placed U.S. Navy EW officers with ground combat units in Iraq to manage electromagnetic spectrum. Creating the new Army career field enables more
efficient soldier preparation to help mitigate ways enemies use electromagnetic spectrum against U.S. troops, Gen. Chiarelli says.</text>
