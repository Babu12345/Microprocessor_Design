  <text>The Boeing Company has received a task order from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deploy video cameras in the Detroit and Buffalo Border Patrol Sectors along the continental United States' northern border. The approximately $20 million Northern Border Project Task Order will provide the Border Patrol with increased surveillance capabilities to provide added security along the St. Clair and Upper Niagara rivers and to help prevent illegal entry of persons and materials into the United States.</text>
