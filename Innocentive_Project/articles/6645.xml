  <text>A fallen soldier has been honored in an unusual way. Lance Cpl. Ryan McCurdy, USMC, was killed by a sniper in Fallujah, Iraq, in January 2006 when he attempted to save a comrade who was also injured. In recognition of his sacrifice, a portable armored wall system has been named "McCurdy's Armor" in his honor. The system is a rapidly deployed protective structure that is easily configurable to meet various force levels. Also in his memory, the Ryan McCurdy Activity Center has been established. A percentage of all future sales of McCurdy's Armor will be donated to the center, which will help provide a safe place for children in Cpl. McCurdy's hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. For more information about the center and to make a donation, visit the Web site.
