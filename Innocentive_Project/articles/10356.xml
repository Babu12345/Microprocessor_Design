  <text>The (ISC)2 Foundation’s information security 2013 scholarship program application process will open on January 1, 2013, and it offers a total of $120,000 in awards to women, graduate students, young professionals and faculty. The foundation will award up to two scholarships totaling $40,000 to women pursuing an education in information security. In addition, it will give seed funding for up to eight grants of $3,000 each to assist graduate students conducting special research. One of the foundation’s other undergraduate scholarship winners will receive the Harold F. Tipton Memorial Scholarship. This scholarship specifically aims to support young information security professionals in their educational pursuits. The foundation also will award faculty certification exam vouchers for one Certified Information Security Systems Professional (CISSP) or Certified Security Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP) exam and, upon certification, it will award the first year of (ISC)2 membership dues. The foundation evaluates applicants based on academic excellence, passion for the industry and financial need. The deadline to submit applications is March 31, 2013, and additional information is available online.
