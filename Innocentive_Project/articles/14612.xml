  <abstract>If individuals or organizations are not pursuing even the most basic cyber hygiene measures, then they may need a cyber concierge to set them straight.</abstract>
  <text>Have you received an email from a friend, family member or colleague that just doesn’t look right? That happens all too often. Most of us are getting smarter about clicking on dubious email links. The questionable email may be followed by an apologetic email, warning us to ignore the bogus email.

Many of us understand why the sender’s address book was hacked: the use of a weak or repeated password. The technology exists to prevent this, but slack user behavior enables cyber predators. If someone does not have the inclination toward cyber discipline, then this function should be outsourced to a personal or business “cyber concierge.”

A cyber concierge would review each individual’s or organization’s cyber environment and implement good cyber practices, starting with strong and nonrepeating passwords. It’s a matter of appropriate cyber behavior, and it will benefit many.
