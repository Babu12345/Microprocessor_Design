The MIDS-LVT provides secure, high-capacity, jam-resistant, digital data and voice communications capability for Navy, Air Force and Army platforms. MIDS JTRS is a pre-planned product improvement replacement transforming the MIDS-LVT into a four-channel, software communications architecture compliant JTRS terminal while maintaining current Link 16 and tactical air navigation capability. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, California, is the contracting activity.</text>
