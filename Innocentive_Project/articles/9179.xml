  <text>Raytheon Network Centric Systems, Marlborough, Massachusetts, is being awarded a $7,027,114 cost-plus-fixed-fee delivery order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement for engineering and technical services in support of the air traffic, navigation, integration, and coordination system for the Air Traffic Control Systems Division. These services will provide engineering changes, field support, maintenance support, depot requirements, and system restoration. In addition, the work provided will include fault isolation, assembly, disassembly, fabrication, refurbishment, upgrading, purchasing of parts, components, assemblies, and materials, and fleet support activities to return the system to a level of serviceability comparable to a new system. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
