  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation has been selected by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop and demonstrate an ultra high-capacity hybrid thermal ground plane needed to overcome heat-related challenges in semiconductors employed in electronic systems. The $1.7 million, 18-month, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is for the first phase of the three-phase DARPA program. </text>
