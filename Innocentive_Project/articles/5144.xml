  <text>A team led by Boeing Advanced Systems has been awarded a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract for the first phase of the Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) program. Team members include DR Technologies, Northrop Grumman Astro Aerospace, Texas A&amp;M University, Spectrolab Incorporated (a Boeing subsidiary) and key suppliers.
