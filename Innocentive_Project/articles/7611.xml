  <text>BAE Systems has received multiple contracts totaling $38 million to provide thermal imagers for the U.S. Army's Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) II and Stryker programs. The TIM1500 thermal imagers used on remote weapon stations allow soldiers to detect and identify enemy targets while remaining protected inside their vehicles through remotely controlled, vehicle-mounted platforms for light- and medium-caliber weapons. The TIM1500 provides extended viewing range capability to detect vehicle targets at a significant range for target acquisition, long-rang surveillance and situational awareness. BAE Systems will provide the TIM1500 to Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace AS. The company recently shipped its 10,000th TIM1500 imager, and increased its production rate in support of Army requirements, including deployment of the units on mine-resistant, ambush protected combat vehicles.</text>
