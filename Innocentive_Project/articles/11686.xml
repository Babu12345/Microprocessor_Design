General Atomics - Aeronautical Systems Inc., Poway, Calif., has been awarded a $12,844,738 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for the MQ-9 stationary targeting improvements. This contract action is for the development and delivery of an improved targeting capability with the Lynx synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on the MQ-9 platform to allow for a more streamlined approach to targeting and quicker decision making by the crew. This effort also builds a certifiable Lynx SAR community sensor model (CSM) in order to allow for future implementation in the full MQ-9 CSM effort as well as a trade study to identify a format for encoding SAR imagery and moving target indicator data within the MQ-9 architecture that enables a common digital video format. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Medium Altitude Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8620-10-G-3038 DO 0054).?</text>
