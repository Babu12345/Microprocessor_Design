  <text>Get your GovLoop fix on the go with its newly released iPhone app, which provides easy mobile access to a number of the community's features, including its job feed, several spotlighted blogs, an aggregated Twitter stream tracking mentions of Gov 2.0 related content, and its event calendar. Because the site's social networking engine, Ning, doesn't have app support, however, users can't log into their accounts or access their personalized content. GovLoop founder Steve Ressler wryly observes about lack of personalized access, "This is 1.0 awesomeness. This app is set up more to consume key government information on the run than control your GovLoop profile. In the future, we'll expand the app more for adding content...and also look to add the app for Blackberry, Android, and other platforms (W7, Palm)." In other words, stay tuned. But in the meantime, find the GovLoop app at the iTunes store.</text>
