  <text>Dassault Avionics has awarded Thales a contract to provide maintenance support for avionics equipment on Rafale combat jets in service with the French armed forces. The 10-year, fixed price contract builds on several previously awarded through-life support contracts awarded to Dassault by SIMMAD, the maintenance arm of the French air force.</text>
