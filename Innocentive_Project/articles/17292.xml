  <abstract>The Army must take a private sector holistic approach to developing future C4ISR capabilities, which will be game-changing.</abstract>
  <text>Taking “a private sector-like holistic approach” to the development of U.S. Army C4ISR will be more important than ever before, according to a former Army CIO/G-6. Lt. Gen. Jeff Sorenson, USA (Ret.), president and partner, A.T. Kearny Public Sector &amp; Defense Services LLC, told an overflow audience at AFCEA’s Army Signal Conference on March 9 that the service must take advantage of commercial information technology advances.

Gen. Sorenson emphasized that new communications and information systems will shape future operations with game-changing capabilities. “We need to take advantage of commercial information technology advances. We need to think through that,” he emphasized.

Yet he also cited the need for better architectural governance of information technology services. Analyzing the operating model a C4ISR program is executing can yield significant benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, he added.

Gen. Sorenson stressed the need to approach C4ISR challenges thoughtfully. “I caution all of you: think about how we provide those [C4ISR] capabilities on time,” he stated.</text>
