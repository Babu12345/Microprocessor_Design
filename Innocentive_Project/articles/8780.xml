  <text>Registration for the Team America Rocketry Challenge-the world's largest student rocket competition-is open through November 30. The first 1,000 teams of three to 10 students will be accepted. Participants must be in the seventh to 12th grades and can be part of any U.S. school, home school or nonprofit youth organization. The top 100 teams will compete in the National Finals next May for a chance to win $60,000 in prizes, scholarships and a Raytheon Company-sponsored trip to an international fly-off in England. The Aerospace Industries Association sponsors the competition. Complete rules and registration information is available at www.rocketcontest.org.</text>
