  <text>Lockheed Martin Corporation, Sunnyvale, California is being awarded a $460 million contract modification to the engineering, manufacturing, and development contract for the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS). The modification revises the ground development and delivery strategy and ultimately implements a more flexible ground infrastructure. It also delivers block 10 of ground systems capability and is built upon a smart architecture that allows the four different mission areas to be segregated to achieve future sustainment efficiencies and enable independent evolution of capability. The block 10 delivery provides an interface for other users as a critical step in ensuring that the SBIRS data is available to a large community of users for both real-time activities as well off-line analysis. The contracting activity is the Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, California.</text>
