  <text>Lockheed Martin, Owego, New York, was awarded a $4.6 million contract from the Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office for the continued development of a maritime canister-launched small unmanned aircraft system. The company is working on a reconfigurable version of the collapsible wing Vector Hawk. The Vector Hawk design is suited to support a man-packable, all-in-one solution that includes a fixed-wing aircraft for standard and long-endurance missions; a collapsible fixed-wing aircraft that can be launched from a tube from land or water; a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft; and a tilt-rotor enabling vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with transition to forward flight.
