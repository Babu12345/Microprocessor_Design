  <text>The Fisher House Foundation, in concert with Newman's Own and the Military Times Media Group, is sponsoring the 2009 Newman's Own Awards. The program awards grants to organizations with ideas to improve the quality of life for military and veterans' families. A total of $75,000 is available. The top prize is $15,000, with the other $60,000 being distributed at the judges' discretion. The deadline to apply is May 1, 2009, and winners will be announced in September 2009. Application guidelines and more information are available online. The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
