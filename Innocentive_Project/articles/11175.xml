  <text>Raydon Corporation, Port Orange, Fla., announced today it was awarded a multi-year contract with a value in excess of $40 million from the Armyâ€™s Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation to design, develop and deliver common driver trainer systems for a variety of tactical vehicles. The Common Driver Trainer system consists of virtual trainers, which will be used to train members of the armed forces in the operation of the combat vehicles being fielded to Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., and to bases in both Korea and Japan, as well as technical refresh to existing common driver trainer systems fielded through the United States.</text>
