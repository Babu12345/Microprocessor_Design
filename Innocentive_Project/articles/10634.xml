General Dynamics Information Technology, Fairfax, Va., was awarded a contract by the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles World Airports, to enhance the closed circuit television (CCTV) and video management and storage system at the Los Angeles International Airport. The contract has a potential value of $27.3 million over three years. General Dynamics will design, install, configure and integrate a state-of-the-art CCTV, video management and storage system which includes more than 2,500 interior and exterior cameras, as well as 120 workstations throughout the airport. The system will integrate with the airport’s existing network, delivering digital storage and streaming video to security stations airport-wide. The CCTV and video management system will also integrate with airport alarms, sensors, audio feeds and a computer-aided dispatch system. In addition, General Dynamics will train more than 120 users. </text>
