  <text>NAVMAR Applied Sciences Corporation, Warminster, Pennsylvania, is being awarded a $12,499,940 cost-plus-fixed-fee order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement for a Phase III B Small Business Innovation Research project under topics N92-170 and N94-178 entitled, respectively, "Laser Radar (LADAR) Identification Demonstration" and "Air Deployable Multi-Parameter Environmental Probe." This order provides for the assessment and deployment of innovative intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and communication systems that, when combined, will extend the range and performance of ISR capabilities of the Persistent Ground Surveillance System Phase IIIB. It also provides for the identification and procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf equipment that enhances these same capabilities. Work will be performed in Patuxent River, Maryland; Yuma, Arizona; and Afghanistan. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, New Jersey, is the contracting activity.</text>
