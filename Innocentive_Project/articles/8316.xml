  <text>General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Fairfax, Virginia has been awarded a more than $4 million task order to provide airborne advanced geospatial intelligence battlespace awareness support to the U.S. Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC). General Dynamics will directly support national priorities, including overseas operations and missile defense, by providing hyper-spectral and multi-spectral imagery production and analysis, data processing and analysis, analytic support, publishing and distribution, and training. NASIC serves as the national and U.S. Defense Department executive agent for the processing, exploitation, analysis, integration and dissemination of measurement and signature intelligence data collected from radar, electro-optical and infrared technical sensors. It prepares signatures of threat targets, develops analytical tools for technical analysis and provides these techniques for the fusion of data in direct support of operational missions.</text>
