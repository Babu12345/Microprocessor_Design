  <text>Homefront Help is SIGNAL Connections’ effort to support U.S. service members, veterans and their families. The column highlights programs that offer resources and assistance to the military community ranging from care packages to benefits and everything in between. In that same spirit, Homefront Help presents opportunities for readers to donate time, offer resources and send words of thanks to those who sacrifice for freedom. Programs that provide services are listed in red. Opportunities for the public to reach out to service members are listed in blue. Each program description includes a link to the organization's Web site, when available.Operation Ward 57Named for the orthopedic ward, or more colloquially the “amputee ward,” at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, this charity supports some of the troops most severely injured in Iraq or Afghanistan. Patients can live in the ward for weeks or months at a time as they adjust to their injuries and new lifestyles. Operation Ward 57 raises money from individuals and companies who want to show their support and donate resources to thank the men and women recovering in the hospital section. Support efforts help not only the troops but also their family members and the staff who care for them. The organization even sends care packages to Ward 57 nurses in Iraq. To date, donations have purchased an array of comforts, including a DVD video library, personal DVD players for patient rooms, new toys for the children’s play area, catered meals and snacks, flowers for the front desk, event tickets, video game consoles and games, and patient and nursing staff microwaves. The charity involves support from famous athletes and musicians, but it raises funds in myriad ways. One of its most prolific efforts is selling football-jersey style shirts that say “Operation Ward 57” on them. Other methods include selling books and a limited number of special edition Star Wars collector coins.Other ideas for supporting Operation Ward 57 are posted on the Web site, as are events with connections to the organization and information about stars who have aided the effort. Additional online offerings include a shop, links for cash donations, contacts and information about sending in photos of people wearing the Ward 57 T-shirts. Jerky for TroopsIf you like dried, spiced meat, and you like U.S. troops, then this is organization for you. The aim of Jerky for Troops is to put a bag of jerky into the hands or field pack of every soldier as often as possible. The charity is seeking donations and voluntary support. For every $100 collected, 10 $10-size bags of jerky will be purchased and shipped through a distribution system in place through the Paralyzed Veterans of America. All bags of wild game and beef jerky are USDA-inspected and vacuum sealed. The food comes in five flavors.Donations to the organization also will be used to offset administrative costs with remaining proceeds used to benefit other troop-support charities. Jerky for Troops has arranged with Wells Fargo, which now includes Wachovia locations, for anyone to go to any branch in all 50 states to donate. Participants should ask the teller to look under “Donations and Memorial Funds” or to search the word “jerky.” Those who want to assist also can set up automatic monthly support. More information about that, as well as contact information for additional details, is available on the Web site.Cup O’ Joe for a JoeCoffee lovers and troop supporters alike will adore this program. More than 60 Green Beans Coffee cafÃ©s in overseas location are enabling people back home in the United States, or anywhere in the world, to buy a service member a cup of coffee. In addition, a portion of the money used to purchase the java goes to military support charities. To donate, visit the Web site and select an amount. As little as $2 will buy a cup of coffee and $60 caffeinates 30 troops. Users can enter any amount they choose and then are invited to write a personal note of encouragement.  Service members interested in receiving a cup of free coffee can use the “Soldier Sign-Up” to register. Additional information, including background on Green Beans Coffee and how to spread the word about Cup O’ Joe for a Joe, also is available online.  The SIGNAL Connectionsstaff encourages readers to take advantage of the programs mentioned in this column and to pass along the information. In addition, if you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please let us know about it. Submit that information to SIGNAL's news editor. The SIGNAL Connections staff has made every effort to verify the legitimacy of these programs and to include information accurate at the time of publication. Inclusion in this column does not constitute an endorsement by AFCEA International or SIGNAL Connections. Homefront Help Archive </text>
