  <text>Raytheon Co., El Segundo, California, has been awarded a $52,578,245 task order for modernization of the Miniature Airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver 2000 (MAGR-2K) to incorporate required Department of Defense and civil mandates to design, test and deliver a military code (M-Code)/automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast capable and to generate and deliver a formal engineering change proposal to the baseline configuration. The contractor will deliver a qualified MAGR-2K-M, which will include GPS M-Code and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast out functionality, while designing out known and anticipated obsolescence issues, and contain provisions for open systems architecture approaches. This effort also will include the necessary MAGR-2K-M Operational Flight Program, modification of any MAGR-2K-M firmware, if required, and accomplishment of complete line replaceable unit level environmental and functional testing and qualification of the MAGR-2K-M system. Work will be performed in El Segundo and is expected to be completed by July 11, 2019. This award is the result of a sole-source acquisition. Fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $12,613,581 are being obligated at the time of the award.
