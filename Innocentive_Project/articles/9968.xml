  <text>Maryland is home to key cybersecurity agencies, such as the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, and the Baltimore Convention Center provides a fitting venue for the nearly 4,000 attendees of the TechNet Land Forces East conference, Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) said prior to the event's opening luncheon. Mikulski spoke about the growing threat of cyber and said too many people believe "cyber is somewhere in the future." She noted that cybersecurity concerns are happening daily and that many of the military and civilian agencies represented at TechNet Land Forces must continue their work to build up the "thin cybersecurity shield." Mikulski said she is confident that Congress will reverse itself and approve cybersecurity legislation by the end of this year. The Senate failed to approve the bill prior to the beginning of the August recess.</text>
