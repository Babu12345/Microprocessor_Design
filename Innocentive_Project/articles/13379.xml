  <text>Do you hanker for the nostalgic feeling of typing on a manual typewriter? Tom Hanks has the solution. The free Hanx Writer app for iPad, created by the actor in partnership with creative agency Hitcents, brings the look, feel and sound of old-fashioned word processing to life.
	Documents created in Hanx Writer can be emailed, printed and shared. Pick from a variety of typewriters, each with unique features.
	Hanks revealed in a New York Times op-ed last year that he uses a manual typewriter almost every day and began collecting them in 1978. The typewriter enthusiast hopes the app brings the experience and sound of typing into the digital age.
	Download the Hanx Writer app from the iTunes App Store.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
