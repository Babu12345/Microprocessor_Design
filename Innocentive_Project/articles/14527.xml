  <text>Insight Public Sector, Tempe, Arizona, is being awarded a potential $156,106,996 fixed-price blanket purchase agreement under the Department of the Navy Enterprise Software Licensing Initiative to provide the renewal of existing software assurance and new Microsoft software licenses. The enterprise-wide agreement is for the Department of the Navy to include the Marine Corps. The resulting award will be subject to the Department of Navy policy entitled “Mandatory Use of Department of the Navy Enterprise Licensing Agreements.” This three-year agreement includes one base year and two one-year option periods, which if exercised, will bring the total to a potential $543,720,000.

Work will be performed in Tempe, Arizona. Work is expected to be completed May 31, 2016. If options are exercised, work will continue through May 31, 2018. This agreement will not obligate funds at the time of award. Blanket purchase agreement orders will be placed by requiring activities as needed during the ordering period. The types of funding to be obligated include operations and maintenance (Navy), other procurement (Navy), and research, development, test and evaluation. This agreement was competitively procured under a brand name only justification in accordance with FAR 8.405-6 via the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule 70.
