  <text>For most Americans, the sight of a flag-draped coffin is a somber reminder of the highest price for freedom. But for the children who survive the deceased, it also means much more-the loss of a parent forever and possibly the end to future plans. The Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation helps to make sure their dreams can still come true by providing scholarship funds for higher education. Though primarily directed toward U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. federal law enforcement families who have lost a parent in the line of duty, the more than $48 million the organization has distributed also has aided families from other military branches. In addition to scholarships, the foundation grants some financial assistance in the cases of Marines' children afflicted with physical or mental disabilities who require special care.

Support from individuals and groups has made the assistance to families possible. The organization has several suggestions for giving including direct donations and scholarships. It also hosts several fundraising events during the year ranging from galas to golf tournaments. Donors can rest assured that their money will be used wisely; the Independent Charities of America awarded its "Seal of Excellence" to the foundation. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
