  <text>Alion Science and Technology, McLean, Va., was awarded a $1.5 million contract by the Spectrum Policy and Programs office, within the Defense Department’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, to study the impact of potentially reallocating or sharing the radio frequency bands between the military and commercial sector. Alion will assist in developing a long-term spectrum strategy that will anticipate, guide and respond to changes in technology, policy and regulation and ensure spectrum access for all current and future military systems. Alion will perform analyses of the potential impacts to defense systems currently using the targeted bands and provide recommendations to Defense Department stakeholders. The task order was awarded through the Weapons Systems Technology Information Analysis Center (WSTIAC) with the period of performance through July 1, 2015. WSTIAC, operated by Alion, is one of nine Defense Technical Information Center Information Analysis Centers.</text>
