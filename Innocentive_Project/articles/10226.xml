  <text>Forgot your phone at home? You can still send texts and see who calls you with instant notifications on your computer screen. The free MightyText app for Android lets you send and receive SMS text messages from your computer or tablet using your phone number.
The program forwards text messages over the phone’s data connection to the MightyText servers. A browser extension then produces the message on the computer or tablet screen. Then, you simply type a reply into your browser and select a contact from your list, and the app sends it in real time. The goal is for the messages to stay fully in sync with your phone’s SMS.
MightyText is free, and it does not add any additional fees to what your carrier charges you. However, the messages route through the phone, so standard SMS fees from your carrier still apply.
Currently, the app has more than 11,000 reviews in Google Play for an average of 4.5 out of 5 stars. Download it here.
