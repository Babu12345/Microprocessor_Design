  <text>The 2011 AFCEA Education Summit, cosponsored by ManTech International and ManTech University, will present educational issues and best practices to benefit AFCEA Chapters. The Summit is held in conjunction with AFCEA's Joint Warfighting Conference on Monday, 9 May in Virginia Beach. It will be broadcast live via streaming video with live chat, enabling online users to listen and join in the discussions. Last year's Summit featured presentations on Adopt-A-School programs, Ways to Engage with the NSTA (National Science Teachers Association), and IRS Rules &amp; Regulations for 501(c)(3) status.
