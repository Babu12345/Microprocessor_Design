Direct Hit Quotes for October:

"What we don't want to do is give commanders history lessons."-Col. Chuck Mehle II, USA, commander, Joint Transformation Command for Intelligence, JFCOM, in "Laboratory Integrates Intelligence."

"It's not blind jamming. We call it smart or responsive jamming. It's responsive because we know the threat, and we respond to this specific threat."-Valery Rousset, director, Thales C4ISR marketing and capability development, command and intelligence unit, in "Jammers Transmit Battlefield Flexibility."
