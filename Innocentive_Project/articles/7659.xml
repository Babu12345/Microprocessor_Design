  <abstract>Technology or magic? The Word Lens app translates printed words from one language to another instantly without any Internet connection.</abstract>
  <text>"Advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." That's just one rave review for the new Word Lens app for iPhone, which translates printed words from one language to another instantly without any Internet connection.

Word Lens from Quest Visual has caused quite a buzz in the developer community since its launch. The app uses the built-in video camera on the iPhone to translate text. Simply look at a sign in another language through your iPhone screen, and the text appears in its translated form. A video on Quest Visual's website shows the technology in action.

No network connection is required for the app to work, and the translated words appear immediately on your video screen.

English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English versions of the app cost $4.99 a piece in the iTunes App Store, but currently you can purchase it for 50-percent off. The deal expires on December 31.

Word Lens is best used on clear text, such as signs and menus. It requires iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS or the iPod Touch with a video camera.
