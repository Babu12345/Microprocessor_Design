  <text>PositiveID Corporation, Delray Beach, Florida, has announced that it, in conjunction with its partner, ENSCO Inc., has been awarded a SenseNet Program contract from the U.S. Department of the Interior on behalf of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Science &amp; Technology Directorate. The goal of this SenseNet award is to implement faster, less expensive bio-threat detection systems, using existing infrastructure where possible, to provide an added level of security. As part of this award, PositiveID will offer its Firefly Dx system, which is a point-of-need system designed to deliver molecular diagnostic results using real-time polymerase chain reaction chemistry. ENSCO will be responsible for the systems integration and decision support.
