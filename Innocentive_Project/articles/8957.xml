  <abstract>Medal of Honor Winner Sgt. Dakota Meyer, USMC, wants to raise $2 million to fund educational opportunities for the children of wounded Marines and Navy Corpsmen.</abstract>
  <text>During a horrific battle in Afghanistan, Sgt. Dakota Meyer, USMC, saved the lives of 13 U.S. Marines and soldiers and 23 Afghans, enduring injuries to himself in the process; he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor. Sgt. Meyer showed more dedication to others in that single firefight than most will do in their entire lives, but instead of resting on his laurels, he has embarked on a new venture to help his fellow Marines. The hero has partnered with the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation to create the Sergeant Dakota Meyer Scholarship for the children of wounded Marines and Navy Corpsmen.

The goal of that effort is to raise $1 million by the foundation's 50th anniversary next May. Sgt. Meyer also has issued his Challenge to America to raise a matching $1 million for a total of $2 million in available funds. Information about how to donate is available on the website.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.
