  <text>Although the official West 2010 Conference doesn't start until tomorrow, those of us from AFCEA International as well as committee members and chapter officers spent this beautiful day indoors in business meetings. We started out the day with a Level 4.4 earthquake at around 6:20 this morning. Nothing major occurred, thank goodness, just a shaking bed for me and others. Some people didn't even feel the tremors, but I'll be glad not to repeat that little surprise!

Today was a great opportunity to meet up with folks we at AFCEA International don't get to see much, like our members from the West Coast and the Southwest. People took advantage of the face-to-face time to network, share information, catch up and just have fun. (After all, how can you not have fun in beautiful San Diego?) 

There was no event planned for this evening; we're looking forward to the USS Midway Magic reception tomorrow night. (But for those of you who are interested, some of my coworkers and I ate at a fabulous Thai restaurant this evening.)

I'm turning in early this evening so that I can rest up for the first official day of the conference tomorrow--beginning bright and early. Stop by the AFCEA and SIGNAL booths (1824 and 1808, respectively) to say hello!</text>
