  <text>The U.S. Navy is moving beyond demonstrations and into the development of a working prototype of a solid-state laser weapon for warships. Officials at the Office of Naval Research (ONR) say the laser weapon would enable sailors to disable and defeat small boats and aerial targets without using bullets. The ONR is planning an industry day on May 16 to provide information on the program to the research and development community. The office is expected to release a Broad Agency Announcement soon afterward to solicit proposals and bids.</text>
