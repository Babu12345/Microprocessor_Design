  <text>Alenia North America has been awarded an approximately $4 million contract by the United States Air Force to provide training of pilots, loadmasters and maintenance personnel on the C-27/G.222 tactical transport aircraft for the Afghanistan Air Force.Â This is a follow-on contract to a previous contract with the U.S. Air Force, which had three training classes on the C-27/G.222. This new contract will consist of four training classes over the next year. In 2008, the company received a contract to supply 18 refurbished C-27/G.222 aircraft for the Afghanistan Air Force. The C-27/G.222 serves as the backbone of the Afghanistan Air Force and has significantly expanded the Afghanistan military's ability to provide humanitarian aid and security to the Afghan population.</text>
