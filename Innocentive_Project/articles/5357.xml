  <text>The Boeing Company has received a $15 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to develop advanced targeting capabilities for the B-52 Stratofortress. The software upgrades will include improvements for transmitting video and targeting information from the targeting pod to friendly forces and will reduce flight crew workload. These capabilities will enable better close air support for ground troops and prepare the most versatile aircraft in the U.S. inventory for future enhancements of the flight crew's situational awareness. The contract also calls for the development of software that will better use new technologies such as the B-52 multi-function color display and a digital-integrated hand controller.
