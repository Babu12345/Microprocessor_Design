  <text>Most deadlines for shipping cards and packages to warzones in time for the holidays have passed, but you can still send e-cards to deployed loved ones overseas courtesy of Real Warriors. Users can choose the animated or still version of the "Happy Holidays from Afar" card. Both feature a military theme as well as the contact information for Real Warriors, which provides help for troops, veterans and family members readjusting to life after deployment.

The organization also offers several non-holiday e-card options with "Welcome Home" or "Reaching Out is a Sign of Strength" themes.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
