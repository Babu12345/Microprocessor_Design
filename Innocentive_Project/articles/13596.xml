Contractor will provide the operational and technical analysis to Air Force Research Laboratories to aide in determining which sensor technology concepts offer the optimal performance in realistic Air Force missions. The SAIT program will assess and understand requirements, perform operational analysis, perform technical analysis, assess advanced technologies, collaborate on-ground and flight demonstrations/tests and explore sensor system integration. Analyses will be examined in context with ongoing Air Force Research Laboratories programs and may also include other Air Force programs as they relate to sensor systems, space sensor programs, multi-intelligence related programs, ISR and Homeland Defense. Work will be performed at Beavercreek, Ohio, and is expected to be completed by September 30, 2020. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition, with five offers received.
