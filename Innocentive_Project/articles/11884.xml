  <text>Lockheed Martin will continue to support a tethered aerostat-based system that provides real-time, around-the-clock reconnaissance and surveillance for warfighters in Afghanistan. The U.S. Army awarded Lockheed Martin a $345 million contract to operate and sustain the Persistent Threat Detection Systems (PTDS). The Army's Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors, Product Manager, Meteorological and Target Identification Capabilities, based at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md., will provide program and acquisition management.</text>
