  <text>General Dynamics Canada recently received an order to supply more than 1,000 Smart Display Units for installation in U.S. Army Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. The order represents the first use of General Dynamics Canada's technology on the MRAP platform, expanding the reach of the company's comprehensive suite of vehicle electronics currently embedded in the majority of the U.S. armoured vehicle fleet. The MRAP vehicles' command, control, communications and computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities are being upgraded to support future growth and improve operational capability for the crews. General Dynamics Canada received the order from WestWind Technologies Inc., which was recently awarded a contract by the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command Life Cycle Management Command.</text>
