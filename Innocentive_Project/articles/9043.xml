  <abstract>American Hometown Heroes connects veterans who want to start companies with marketing and other support from independent Yellow Pages publishers.</abstract>
  <text>American Hometown Heroes is an initiative launched late last year by a coalition of independent Yellow Pages publishers. It aims to give veterans a leg up on becoming entrepreneurs and to reduce the high numbers of unemployment and underemployment among those who have served in the U.S. military. The involved partners offer business and professional advice to veterans starting companies in the communities the publishers serve. Approved grant applicants will receive free online and Yellow Pages advertising along with help throughout the first year of starting a new business.

Veterans interested in applying can find details on the program's How The Program Works page. Qualification requirements and a link to application forms are available through the Sign Up page.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
