  <text>AAI Corporation, an operating unit of Textron Systems, a Textron Inc. company, announced today that Italy's Ministry of Defense - Directorate of General Aeronautical Armament has selected AAI's Shadow 200 Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems for the Italian Army. Under this 51 million euro-$64 million-award, Italy will purchase four Shadow systems for deployment alongside NATO forces. System requirements include a small system footprint; easy transportation using small vehicles or C-130 Hercules aircraft; ease of use; interoperability with other NATO forces; and the ability to take off and land from small, semi-prepared airfields.</text>
