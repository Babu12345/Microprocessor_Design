  <text>The U.S. Naval Operational Logistics Support Center (NOLSC) has awarded Alion Science and Technology a $15 million contract to support the center's efforts to integrate and modernize its logistical support systems for deployable Navy and Coast Guard Units. Under the three-year agreement, the company will provide the NOLSC with logistics planning, modeling and simulation, concept generation and development, and manning, personnel and training analysis. Alion will also conduct the front end assessment for the Littoral Combat Ship, which will serve as the basis for all manning, personnel and training decisions affecting end strengths and budgets.</text>
