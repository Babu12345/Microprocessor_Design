  <text>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded R.W. Beck, a subsidiary of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) a $21 million contract to support the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy's Biomass Program. As part of the program, the DOE announced that it will partially fund via grants the design, construction and operation of 18 integrated ethanol biorefinery pilot and demonstration projects, helping to promote the development and commercialization of cellulosic and algae derived biofuel and biochemical production. Under the contract, R.W. Beck will serve as the DOE's independent engineer on these projects, providing services including assistance in program management, technical and financial due diligence, construction and operations monitoring, and Recovery Act compliance.</text>
