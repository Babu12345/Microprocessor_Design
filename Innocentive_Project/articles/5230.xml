  <text>The Boeing Company has been awarded a U.S. Army contract valued at approximately $36 million to continue developing a truck-mounted, high-energy laser weapon system. Boeing will complete the design of a rugged beam control system on a heavy expanded mobility tactical truck. Boeing then will build, test and evaluate the system. Boeing also will develop the system-engineering requirements for the high-energy laser technology demonstrator laser weapon system.</text>
