  <text>This military-style countdown calendar helps you keep track of important events and keep others in the loop. How many days have passed since you were deployed? How many hours remain until you can head back home? Find all the information you need in a click on your smartphone. The Short Timer app for iPhone and Android allows you to program in important dates and events and watch the days tick away. It is ideal for enlisted personnel to monitor milestones and share information with friends and family. Users can simply send automatic updates to loved ones using built-in Twitter and Facebook broadcasts. The app, developed by DigiBuro, is available for $1.99 in the iTunes App Store and $0.99 in the Amazon Appstore for Android.
