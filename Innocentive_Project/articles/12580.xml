  <text>Creating a floor plan typically requires a tape measure and some patience, but the free RoomScan app for iPhone could make the process much easier.
	Users simply tap each wall in a room with their phone, and the app generates a drawing of the floor plan in secondsâ€”no sketching or measuring required. Add doors to the plan by touching the door frame.
	According to the app creator Locometric, RoomScan draws complex rooms just as easily as small rectangular rooms. To improve the accuracy, users can pair the app with a laser measure, and the program combines the measurements for one floor plan. Measurements are available in metric, feet and inches along with East Asian units.
	The free version limits the features with an option to upgrade to a pro version for $4.99. Download the app from the iTunes App Store.
	Want to see the app in action? Check out the video below.
