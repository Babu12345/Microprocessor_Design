  <text>Active duty, Reserve and Guard military members from any branch of service, including the Coast Guard, who want new wheels can take advantage of discounts on 2010 and 2011 Chevrolet, Buick and GMC vehicles. Spouses also are eligible for the special pricing, which applies to the purchase or lease of up to two cars. In many cases, the military discount can be combined with other incentives for extra savings. Deals vary by location and model, but interested parties can gather some specifics on the website under the Regional Incentives tab. The site also posts information about other ways military members can receive benefits in its Support Our Military section.  Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
