  <text>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency (IARPA) announced the public release of the Accurate Events from Natural Text (ACCENT) technology. ACCENT is a state-of-the-art automated event coder capable of identifying nearly 300 types of sociopolitical events in text. IARPA hopes the software release will spur increased activity in the research community.

Developed by Raytheon BBN under multiple government contracts, ACCENT is based on the Statistical Entity and Relation Information Finding technology developed under Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funding. It is now regularly used at the U.S. Strategic Command in support of systems monitoring and forecasting national and international crises.</text>
