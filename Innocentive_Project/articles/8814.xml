  <text>One of the government's premier scientific research institutions is focusing its resources on defending computer systems against cyberattackers. The Sandia National Laboratories has concluded a recent two-day conference on cybersecurity by announcing plans for a new Cyber Engineering Research Institute (CERI) that will have a presence on both Sandia campuses in New Mexico and California. CERI is expected to more closely coordinate with industry and universities in developing new tactics to enhance cybersecurity. CERI also will explore ways to encourage more students to take up cybersecurity studies and may develop a major prize competition to spur innovation in cybersecurity.</text>
