  <text>Oracle America Inc., Redwood City, California, is being awarded a $19,050,000 ceiling increase modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price, sole source award commercial contract (N65236-13-D-2157) to provide post deployment systems support for Increment 1 of Global Combat Support System-Marine Corps. This contract is currently in its first option period. If the second (final) option period is exercised, it would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $68,500,000. Work will be performed in Redwood City, California, and is expected to be completed by September 2015. If the second option is exercised, work would continue until September 2016. No funds will be obligated at the time of award and no contract funds will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was previously procured on a sole source basis with one proposal solicited from Oracle America via the Commerce Business Daily's Federal Business Opportunities website, and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center e-Commerce Central website. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic, Charleston, South Carolina, is the contracting activity.</text>
