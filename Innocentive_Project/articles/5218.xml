  <text>System integration is the name of the game if the U.S. Army is to be able to succeed in this new age of persistent conflict, said Lt. Gen. Michael A. Vane, USA, director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center. Saying that the Army is challenged to fight this new war, the general called for network access for the leader and the soldier.

Land power, more than any other domain, requires integration of processes and capabilities, he told a luncheon audience. And, this state of persistent conflict has increased the importance of the individual soldier. That translates to a broad-based integration of systems to extend beneficial capabilities down to the warfighter.

A key element is the development of architectures, Gen. Vane pointed out. He said the operational architecture must drive the system architecture, which must be supported by a technology architecture. Right now, teams are working toward vital integration goals.
