The engineering tasks and analyses are necessary to authorize P-8A operations for up to 150 percent of the specified service life of the airframe, dependent upon the results of the extended lifetime testing. Fiscal 2013 Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation, Navy contract funds in the amount of $128,393,761 are being obligated on this award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
