  <text>The AFCEA International Online Directories now include a directory featuring profiles of companies that offer solutions to protect the land, air, sea and cyber domains. The Homeland Security Directory joins the Cybersecurity, Health IT and Intelligence online directories, which were created in response to a call from government leaders.The AFCEA Source Book online is a vital resource to government agencies and the commercial sector. Not only is it widely available through the Internet but also now contains both AFCEA corporate members and nonmembers alike, providing an even broader view of available solutions. Because it is searchable in a number of combined ways, the Source Book allows agencies and companies to pinpoint the precise types of companies and capabilities they need. For example, a large corporation can hunt for 8(a) companies that focus on biometric products/services to become part of a team vying for a government contract. The Homeland Security Directory includes information about companies that design and develop technologies such as sensors, vulnerability assessments or information security solutions. To be included in the new directory, the AFCEA point of contact updates the corporate profile through the AFCEA portal and chooses business categories with an orange dot that are applicable to the organizationâ€™s specialties.For additional information, contact Maryann Lawlor at (703) 631-6179.</text>
