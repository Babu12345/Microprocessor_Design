  <text>Needing a new long-range anti-ship missile, the U.S. Navy has configured a Tomahawk cruise missile to perform that role. The service saved a large amount of scarce funding in adapting an existing system instead of developing a new one, stated a high-ranking defense official.

Robert O. Work, deputy secretary of defense, told the morning audience about the missile at West 2015, being held in San Diego, February 10-12. He explained how the Tomahawk, which was escorted by an F/A-18 Hornet during its demonstration last month, changed course during flight when it was guided by another aircraft to strike a ship a long distance from the Arleigh Burke–class destroyer USS Kidd.

The target ship was moving when it was hit, Work said, which gives the Navy a new long-range capability. He described it as “an inexpensive game-changer,” and called for more developments of this type to advance capabilities at lower cost.
