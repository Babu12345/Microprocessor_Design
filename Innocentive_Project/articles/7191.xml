  <text>"Support. Defend. Fish." That's the motto of the Army Bass Anglers, a group made up of active duty military members and veterans who compete in fishing tournaments to raise awareness for Returning Heroes Home and Fishing For Freedom events. Both programs support the military community. The latter also involves bass fishing tournaments where fishermen partner with soldiers and veterans, including those who have been wounded. Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy Bass Angler groups support the missions as well. In addition to the work with Returning Heroes Home, Army Bass Anglers has joined forces with the Lone Star Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans of America and Heroes on the Water to raise funds and awareness for all warriors and for recreation and therapeutic activities in special facilities and events designed only for them. Angler team members also offer tips and ideas for fellow fishing lovers and the website has information about fishing conditions near certain Army posts. More information is available online. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
