The Air Defense, Missile Warning, and Space Defense systems that support the missions of North American Aerospace Defense, U.S. Northern Command, and U.S. Strategic Command will continue to be sustained by Lockheed Martin, Colorado Springs, Colorado. The U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center selected Lockheed Martin to provide operations, maintenance, and sustainment of these missions under the Integrated Space Command and Control (ISC2) contract. The contract consists of three one- year options, with a total potential value of $250 million. ISC2 provides geographically disparate commanders the ability to monitor and assess multi-mission threats concurrently. Under the sustainment contract, Lockheed Martin will support the space, air defense and missile warning missions, ensuring that information and data is seamlessly shared between those and other C2 systems. </text>
