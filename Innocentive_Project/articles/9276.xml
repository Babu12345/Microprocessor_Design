  <text>Want to take your work on the road? The CloudOn app lets you access Microsoft Office from your iPad. The free app integrates with virtual versions of Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint hosted in the cloud. Simply connect to the Internet and the program lets you create, view and edit files. It also integrates with Dropbox so that you can save files right to your workspace. With CloudOn, you have the ability to rename, delete and manage documents in your Dropbox account; track changes while reviewing Word documents; display animation and transitions in PowerPoint presentations; open files directly from email; and automatically save documents, among others. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store. If you have a suggestion for a Cool App-titude feature, email Rachel Eisenhower at reisenhower@afcea.org or send a tweet to @rachel_signalmg.
