  <text>Florida State University (FSU) has received more than $14 million in grants to create a program that will provide focused training, resources and support to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers. FSU’s Florida Center for Research in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (FCR-STEM) and its partners are creating FCR-STEMLearn with the new grants from the Florida Department of Education. ??“FCR-STEMLearn is a comprehensive program to deepen teachers’ knowledge of mathematics and science, to establish collaborative lesson study teams at their schools and to enhance their capacity to teach challenging courses in these critical fields,” says Rabieh Razzouk, FCR-STEM’s acting director and the principal investigator on the partnership. 
	The program will include intensive two-week professional-development summer institutes, follow-up support to teachers during the academic year and new instructional resources, available any time through a collaborative online portal for Florida teachers known as CPALMS.?
