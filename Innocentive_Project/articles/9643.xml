  <text>American Science and Engineering Incorporated, Billerica, Massachusetts, recently announced the receipt of a $3.1 million order from the U.S. government for the service and maintenance of ZBV Military Trailers (ZBV Mil Trailers), rugged X-ray screening systems built onto standard military trailers. With one-sided Z Backscatter imaging, security officials can use the ZBV Mil Trailer for screening vehicles, containers, and other cargo for terrorist threats and contraband simply by towing the trailer past the subjects, or by remaining stationary while vehicles drive past the trailer. The ZBV Mil Trailer produces photo-like images of the contents of a container or vehicle, highlighting high-risk organic materials, such as explosives.</text>
