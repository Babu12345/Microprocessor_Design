	MyCongress App

The MyCongress app available for the iPad and iPhone helps users get in touch with members of congress with a tap of their finger. The portal of information about elected U.S. congressional officials tracks related news, videos and Twitter feeds. Users can look up an official's open Congress profile and contact them directly. The program locates officials using a ZIP code or by accessing the user's location with the iPhone or iPad's Global Position System and determining where they reside. Users also can find officials by name, state, party or chamber. When the representative or senator's name is selected, a page will appear with the official's basic information along with recent news, YouTube videos and their Twitter feed, if available. The latest version 1.1, updated by the developer ObjectiveApps in May, allows users to bookmark officials to watch. Marked congress members will appear on the homepage next time the user launches the application or when they return to the home screen. The app is free and available in the iTunes App Store. Users can follow the @mycongressapp Twitter steam for the latest updates and information on the product.
