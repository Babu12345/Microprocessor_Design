  <text>Turn your smartphone into an extension of your brain. The free Evernote app helps you remember anything and everything using notes, snapshots and recordings. Plus, you can instantly synchronize your information to your Mac or Windows desktop. Use the app to create text, photo and audio notes that can be easily searched or marked as "Favorite" for quick access. Each reminder also includes geolocation information for mapping and search. Put your ideas and inspiration all in one place. Snap a photo of a business card to easily store contacts; capture plane tickets and confirmation numbers; keep notes from your meetings organized; plan your next trip; photograph product labels to keep a record of your favorites; and jot down random thoughts or ideas. The Evernote app is compatible with iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Android. Download it now in the iTunes App Store or the Android Market.
