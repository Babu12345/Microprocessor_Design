  <text>L-3 Communications Corp., doing business as Warrior Systems Div., Tempe, Arizona, is being awarded a $9,900,000 firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for high-performance image intensifier tube assembly. The image intensifier tubes are in direct support of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division in-service engineering agent for the repair and life cycle support of the AN/PVS-15 series of night vision goggles and AN/PVS-18 series of night vision monocular for the U.S. Special Operations Command. 

The system’s screens will provide special operations forces with enhanced surveillance, identification, recognition, and detection in all light and weather conditions, especially where vision is limited or restricted due to obscured and low/no light conditions. Work will be performed in Tempe, Arizona, and is expected to be completed by March 2020. 

Fiscal 2015 operations and maintenance (Navy) contract funds in the amount of $47,300 will be obligated at time of award and will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured and solicited via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with three offers received. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity (N00164-15-D-JQ23).
