  <abstract>The New Africa Command: A Hedge Against Neocolonialism or a True Agent of Change? By Cmdr. Gregory E. Glaros, USN (Ret.)</abstract>
  <text>When AFRICOM is established as an "interagency" command, and a U.S. State Department official acts as its deputy, what will the U.S. Commerce Department contribute? How will non-governmental organizations (NGOs) participate since they have the greatest insight into widespread troubles?Will NGOs have a say in crafting intervention strategies? Can these combined, organizationally diverse voices divert future disaster? The Defense Department is an institution keenly, if not uniquely, capable of recognizing strategic interests, but can it alone provide regional stability by fostering economic development?</text>
