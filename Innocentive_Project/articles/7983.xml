  <text>When sick and wounded troops are evacuated out of war zones, they often arrive at military hospitals with nothing more than the clothes on their backs, and those are often damaged from battle or purposely cut to treat wounds. This leaves injured warfighters little recourse other than to use their own money to purchase the basic personal effects they require. Enter Jammies for GIs. Despite the name, the group does more than hand out nightwear. It works to provide a clean change of clothes, entertainment and other goods to those who came to harm fighting for their country.

Jammies for GIs relies on volunteers and donations to carry out its mission. Anyone who would like to get involved is encouraged to visit the organization's website for volunteer and donation ideas. Hospital staff members who have identified needs within their unit can contact Jammies for GIs, which will do its best to fill the gaps.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
