  <text>HP Enterprise Services today signed a continuity of services contract with the U.S. Department of the Navy, valued in excess of $3 billion, if all options are exercised.Â The contract enables the Navy to transition the comprehensive, end-to-end information technology services presently provided under the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) contract to the Next Generation Enterprise Network contract in a manner that minimizes the possible risks to the Navy's information technology operations and security, according to an HP announcement.</text>
