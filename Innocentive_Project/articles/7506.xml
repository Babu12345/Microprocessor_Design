  <text>Northrop Grumman Space and Missions Systems Corporation, San Jose, California, recently received two MQ-9 Reaper awards. The first is a contract valued at more than $23 million, which provides for the design and build of a pod-mounted prototype for the MQ-9 platform. The second is a contract modification, for which more than $5 million has been obligated. Under the modification, Northrop Grumman will provide for a prototype sensor for the MQ-9 installed in a pod to support a limited flight demonstration of the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload-2 functionally. The contractor shall support the General Atomics effort to certify the pod for airworthiness on the MQ-9. Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
