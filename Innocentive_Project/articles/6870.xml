  <text>SIGNAL Magazine and AFCEA extend heartfelt sympathies to the Polish people for the loss of President Lech Kaczynski, Gen. Franciszek Gagor (PAF), chief of the Polish Armed Forces General Staff, and other leaders. We stand with the Polish people during this time of grief. Just two months ago, Gen. Gagor shared his views on the future of Poland's military with SIGNAL readers in a special report on Poland.</text>
