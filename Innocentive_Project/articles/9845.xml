  <text>Marines, soldiers, sailors and airmen who think they represent the best-of-the-best of military communicators have an unusual opportunity to prove it. The Joint Communications Unit (JCU)-comprising elite military signaleers who support special operations forces-is looking to take on 100 new members over the next few years. Applicants will have to pass mental, physical and skills tests, but selection will result in intense, advanced technical certifications. Unit members also receive special pay benefits. The lowest rank in the JCU is an E-5. Most positions are for enlisted members, with some mid-grade officer billets. More details about the recruiting process are posted on the website. Interested warfighters also can call the unit at (910) 243-0203/0493 or DSN at (312) 383-0203/0493 or email jcurecruiting@jdi.socom.mil.</text>
