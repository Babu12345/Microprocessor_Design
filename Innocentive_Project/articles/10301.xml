Harris Corporation, Melbourne, Fla., has received $7 million in orders to deliver public safety and tactical communications systems to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard. The orders were awarded through the five-year, $3 billion DHS Tactical Communications (TacCom) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract vehicle. Harris will provide the U.S. Coast Guard with Falcon III AN/PRC-117G multiband manpack tactical radios that will be installed across the Coast Guard fleet to provide interoperable tactical communications with local, state and federal agencies, as well as the Department of Defense. Separately, Harris also will provide the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness with a standards-based P25 Land Mobile Radio system. The Center, located on Fort McClellan in Alabama, is charged with training first responders in recovery tactics for response to critical homeland security situations. </text>
