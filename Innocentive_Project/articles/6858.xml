  <text>This month's SIGNAL Connections survey asks readers to weigh in with the main reason they joined AFCEA. Feel free to discuss the value of your AFCEA membership here, whether your affiliation is as an individual member or a corporate associate. And if you have suggestions on benefits you'd like to see, share them here as well.</text>
