  <text>EDO Communications and Countermeasures Systems Incorporated, also known as ITT Force Protection Systems, Thousand Oaks, California, is being awarded a $103,000,905 firm-fixed-price contract to procure 3,351 Band-C upgrade kits, initial spares and consumables, engineering support services hours, and data to upgrade fielded Counter Radio-Controlled Electronic Warfare Vehicle Receiver/Jammer (CVRJ) Systems. CVRJ systems are vehicle-mounted electronic jammers designed to prevent the initiation of radio controlled improvised explosive devices. This contract was not competitively procured as no other source can meet the required schedule for fielding a unit to counter new, emerging threats against military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
