  <text>Lockheed Martin Corp. Missiles and Fire Control, Orlando, Florida, is being awarded $43,400,000 firm-fixed-price contract for procurement of 14 AN/AAQ-30 target sight systems (TSS) and data to be integrated into U.S. Marine Corps Cobra attack helicopters. This integration is part of the U.S. Marine Corps H-1 upgrades program for the remanufacture of legacy aircraft with state of the art designs incorporated into the existing AH-1W fleet, converting them to AH-1Z. The AN/AAQ-30 TSS provides target identification and tracking, passive targeting for integrated weapons, including Hellfire missiles, and a laser designation capability supporting friendly laser-guided weapons.

Work will be performed in Orlando, Florida (80 percent), and Ocala, Florida (20 percent), and is expected to be completed by November 2017. Fiscal 2015 aircraft procurement (Navy) contract funds in the amount of $43,400,000 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The contract was not competitively procured and was issued on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity (N00164-15-C-JQ29).?Â </text>
