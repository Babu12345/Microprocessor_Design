  <text>The unemployment rate for veterans of recent conflicts—that is, those who served during the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts—dropped a bit last year, according to Labor Department statistics.
	In 2013, the unemployment rate fell to 9 percent from 9.9 percent for post-2001 veterans. The corresponding rate for all veterans fell to 6.6 percent from 7 percent in 2012, according to Labor secretary Thomas E. Perez.
	Michelle Obama and Jill Biden have focused their White House efforts on finding employment opportunities for veterans.
	“Our nation’s veterans and their families have made countless sacrifices on behalf of our nation,” says Keith Kelly, assistant secretary of labor for veterans’ employment and training service. “Who deserves opportunity more than those who have put their lives on the line defending it?”
