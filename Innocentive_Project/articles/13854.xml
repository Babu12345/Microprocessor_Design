  <text>Sonatech Inc., doing business as Channel Technologies Group, Santa Barbara, California, is being awarded a $34,384,013 firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the production of TR-343 sonar transducer ship sets. The TR-343 transducer is part of the AN/SQS-53 hull-mounted sonar array assembly, which is a component of the AN/SQQ-89(V) acoustic sonar weapons system. The AN/SQQ-89(V) is a fully integrated surface ship undersea warfare combat system with the capability to search, detect, classify, localize and attack submarine targets. The contract will provide fabrication, assembly, inspection, test and delivery of TR-343 sonar transducer ship sets. The contract will support the new construction of DDG Arleigh Burke-class Navy destroyer ships. This contract combines purchases for the U.S. Navy (85 percent) and the government of Japan (15 percent). Work will be performed in Santa Barbara, California, and is expected to be completed by December 2019. Fiscal 2014 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding in the amount of $2,122,489 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with two offers received. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity (N00164-15-D-GP71).
