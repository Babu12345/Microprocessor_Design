  <text>Engineering Services Network Incorporated, Arlington, Virginia, (ESN) recently announced it was awarded a contract worth up to $24.5 million from the U.S. Navy to support the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific Integrated Voice Networks Branch and provide telephony network support. The award is an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. If exercised, option periods would bring the potential ceiling value to an estimated $41.2 million. ESN will provide technical support for the Integrated Voice Networks Branch (Code 41330) and the Integrated Voice Communications System Life Cycle Support Facility in performance of the in-service engineering authority duties, and other voice communications duties and assignments.  </text>
