  <text>3 Phoenix Incorporated, Chantilly, Virginia, is being awarded a $12,315,777 modification to provide engineering services to support software development, procurement of commercial-off-the-shelf products, and hardware/software integration required to provide improved technology for Navy open architecture and network centric operations and warfare systems in support of Virginia class submarines and other submarine/surface ship systems. This requirement includes system engineering, architecture design, software engineering, prototyping, integration, and test activities. This effort is for phase three of a Small Business Innovative Research, topic N04-138, "Real-time Data Fusion and Visualization Interface for Environmental Research Data." These services will be rendered as needed to support the Navy's initiative to maintain the pace of performance improvement through judicious use of lower power electronics, advanced algorithm design, and innovative applications of open software and hardware. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
