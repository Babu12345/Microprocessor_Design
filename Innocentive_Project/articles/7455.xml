  <abstract>The worst extremist group threatening India may be neither Muslim nor Maoist but instead Hindu.</abstract>
  <text>India faces a more significant challenge from home-grown extremists than from external sources, said an expert from India with the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. Shyamsunder Tekwani, an associate professor for counterterrorism, international security, media and conflict, went so far to say that the worst group is neither Muslim nor Maoist but instead Hindu. Tekwani told a TechNet Asia-Pacific 2010 panel audience that Hindu fundamentalists pose a greater threat to India than Muslim extremism exported from Pakistan. Many Muslim attacks in India are a direct response to what Hindu extremists have done to Muslims in India, he declared. The Maoist threat comes from the native Naxalite movement. Its adherents control a large swath of the center of the country that is now known as Red India. The government considers this group a serious threat to India, Tekwani stated. The government also is concerned with the threat of cyberwarfare, he added.</text>
