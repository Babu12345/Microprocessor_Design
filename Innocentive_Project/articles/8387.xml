  <text>FLIR Systems Incorporated, Wilsonville, Oregon, is being awarded more than $7 million for electro-optics sensor (EOS) systems, failure analysis, repairs, upgrades, field repairs, provision item order spares, maintenance training, and data in support of the Naval Shipboard Protection System program. The EOS systems are rugged and ship-mountable to provide surface ships with a day and night, high-resolution, infrared and visible band imaging capability, as well as range finding capability, to augment existing optical and radar sensors for the purpose of detecting and identifying asymmetric threats. The EOS systems will be operated on military maritime crafts exposed to harsh operating and environmental conditions. The EOS systems will be used to detect threats entering into a U.S. Navy exclusion zone. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity.</text>
