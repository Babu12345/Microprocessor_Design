  <text>Clear away the coffee table clutter. The Dijit Universal Remote app transforms your iPhone, iPad or Android into a one-stop control for all the different media players and sound systems in your home. The program, developed by Dijit Media Incorporated, works together with Griffin Technology's Beacon, which acts as a bridge between your entertainment system and your smartphone or tablet. The Beacon is sold separately for iOS and Android, and it costs $69.99. Then the free Dijit app works to control the system and create your universal remote. Once installed, the app provides a customizable interface. Select which buttons should appear; group commands to control multiple systems with the one click; and create a unique guide using only the shows or channels you want to watch. The Dijit app can support multiple systems in different rooms or houses. Download it from the iTunes App Store or the Android Market.
