Simlat Ltd., Herzliya, Israel, was selected to provide an unmanned aerial system (UAS) training center, including its high-fidelity UAS training systems to the Finnish Defence Forces (FDF), as part of the FDF Mini UAS program. The simulation center will support the new Orbiter Mini UAS fleet, which was selected by the FDF last summer as its future UAS. The program includes the manufacturing and delivery of Orbiter Mini UAS, as well as the development of independent operational, training and maintenance capability.</text>
