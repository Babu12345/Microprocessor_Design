  <text>Summer vacation doesn't necessarily mean happiness for all school kids. The Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury released in April the Children of Military Service Members Resource Guide to help children affected by the stresses of a military lifestyle at any time of the year. This online document is designed for families and health care providers to use as they address the mental and emotional health needs of toddlers to teenagers. Various age-appropriate resources are identified under topic areas such as deployment, homecoming, loss of a parent and moving. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
