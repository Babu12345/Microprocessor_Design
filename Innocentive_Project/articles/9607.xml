  <text>Raytheon Company, Sudbury, Massachusetts, is being awarded a $9,223,000 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification for engineering services in support of the Cobra Judy Replacement (CJR) Program. The CJR Program designs, develops, and acquires a functional replacement ship and mission equipment suite for the current Cobra Judy and USNS Observation Island. The CJR mission is the same as that of the system it replaces: long-dwell foreign ballistic missile data collection in support of international treaty verification. The mission systems onboard the replacement ship includes high-power, instrumentation-class S-band and X-band radar phased arrays and the necessary ancillary equipment to support the mission. Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington DC, is the contracting activity.</text>
