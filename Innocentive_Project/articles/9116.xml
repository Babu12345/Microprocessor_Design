  <text>The Navmar Applied Sciences Corporation, Warminster, Pennsylvania, is being awarded a $9,640,400 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for a Phase III Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project under Topic N04-237, "Mobile Shallow Water Antisubmarine Target System."  The objective of this contract is to mature the design of the Shallow Water Target (SWT) System developed under the Phase II SBIR into a production-ready, over-the-side radio-frequency (RF) prototype SWT System and submarine simulator. In addition, this contract provides for research studies on RF and radiated signals; development of algorithms and display concepts; performance and functional testing; on-site-integration and field testing; training tools and documents; and on-site and post-test training. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, New Jersey, is the contracting activity.</text>
