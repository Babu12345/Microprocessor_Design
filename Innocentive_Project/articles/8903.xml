  <abstract>Pay no shipping on select packages when sent to APO or FPO addresses. But act fast because the deadline for combat-zone orders is December 3.</abstract>
  <text>Hickory Farms is offering military families and friends a chance to send gift packages to APO or FPO addresses without paying shipping fees. The company sells a variety of packages of meats, cheeses, fruit and nuts that qualify for the deal. However, to take advantage of the free shipping customers have to act fast. Combat-zone Christmas delivery is guaranteed only on orders placed by December 3. For other military addresses, customers have to order by December 10 to ensure packages reach their destinations by the 25th. (Reminder: military mail service in Iraq has ended.)

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their familiesÂ please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
