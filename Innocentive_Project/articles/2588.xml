In addition, he works for a local university and serves as a member of Service Academy Nomination Selection Board of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH).

He organized the chapter’s Young AFCEAN kick-off event and led many programs at monthly meetings. As a result, the chapter more than tripled its 2009 Young AFCEAN growth goal. He served as the chapter’s Young AFCEAN director for 2010. He has reached out to local and base military and civilian leaders to attend and speak at the monthly meetings for the Young AFCEAN Mentorship Program. In 2010 alone, Weinstein orchestrated funding and support for more than eight highly successful events. Weinstein serves on the InfoTech Community Leaders Reception and 2011 Dayton-Wright Chapter Officers Nomination committees. He co-chaired the 2010 Dayton-Wright Valentine Ball, one of the chapter's premier annual events, which raised a record $14,000 for local area schools and students. In recognition of his leadership and commitment to education, AFCEA proudly names Casey Weinstein as AFCEAN of the Month.</text>
