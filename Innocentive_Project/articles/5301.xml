  <text>General Dynamics C4 Systems has received a $70 million contract to equip the 5th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division Stryker Brigade Combat Team with a new, lighter-weight version of the Land Warrior integrated fighting system. The Land Warrior system provides command and control, computing, communication and position-locating technologies that will digitally link the Stryker brigade's infantry soldiers to the battlefield network while they are on missions, improving their situational awareness, survivability, mission speed and effectiveness.</text>
