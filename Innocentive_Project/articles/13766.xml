  <text>Areté Associates, Tucson, Arizona, is being awarded a $11,742,120 modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract (N61331-11-C-0007) for one AN/DVS-1 coastal battlefield reconnaissance and analysis (COBRA) Block I low-rate initial production system to support the littoral combat ship mine countermeasures mission. The primary mission of AN/DVS-1 COBRA is to conduct unmanned aerial tactical reconnaissance in littoral battlespace for detection and localization of mine fields and obstacles in the surf zone and beach zone prior to amphibious assault. Work will be performed in Tucson, Arizona, and is expected to be completed by February 2017. Fiscal 2014 research, development, test and evaluation funding in the amount of $3,400,000 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, Florida, is the contracting activity.</text>
