  <text>Leave your toolkit at home with the Swiss Army Knife app for Android. The program packs six tiny tools right into your phone, including a flashlight, ruler, timer, stopwatch, compass and level.

Each feature is one tap away from the home screen. The simple design makes the tools fast and easy to access.

The compass tool uses your phones built-in compass and accelerometer to move as you rotate the phone. In addition, the bubble level contains three separate levels: vertical, circular and horizontal.

Download the Swiss Army Knife app for free from the Android Market.
