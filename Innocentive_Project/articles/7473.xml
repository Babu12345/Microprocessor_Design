  <text>The United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defence has extended its contract with Systematic to continue to provide expert support to the UK's involvement in the Multilateral Interoperability Programme (MIP). The contract is valued at more than Â£1 million (nearly $2 million). Systematic provides maintenance for the UK MIP Gateway, the capability for a bilateral United States-UK military interoperability exercise in 2010, support to a UK-French military exercise planned for June 2011, and continued technical support for the UK's membership and contribution to MIP standardization working groups and MIP test events.</text>
