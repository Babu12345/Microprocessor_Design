  <text>Ultra Electronics, Braintree, Massachusetts, is being awarded a $49,200,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with cost-plus-fixed-fee/firm-fixed-price provisions for TR-317/353 submarine transducers. The TR-317/353 submarine transducers detect and localize targets by active sonar and are installed in the main hull-mounted active spherical array on submarines. Large numbers of these transducers are stocked by the Navy to support fleet requirements for new and restored units. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, Rhode Island, is the contracting activity.</text>
