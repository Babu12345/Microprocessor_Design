  <text>'Tis the season to head out and about to shop, travel and visit with family, and the free ParkMe app could make your activities easier this year. It features location and rate information for lots and garages near you along with a live map of available street parking. In addition, ParkMe provides detailed directions to the parking, including photos so you know what to expect. Find real-time information on lot availability, make reservations in advance for select areas and set the parking timer to avoid having your meter run out.

The ParkMe database contains parking information for more than 500 cities around the world, and full-time researchers ensure the data remains accurate as prices fluctuate.

Download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
