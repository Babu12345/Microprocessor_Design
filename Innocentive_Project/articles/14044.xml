  <text>Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, USMC, has taken command as the 20th director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, making him the first U.S. Marine to take the helm of the military’s spy agency.

In his new role, Gen. Stewart also serves as the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR). He is stationed at DIA headquarters at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

“While I’ve had the opportunity to serve in many positions, I must say that my standing here today is one of the greatest honors of my career,” Gen. Stewart said Friday during a change-of-command ceremony. “My tenure here will not be about reversing the past or reinventing the agency or its mission. It will be about continuity and striving for excellence in our profession. … It’s about writing the next chapter, not a new book.” 

Gen. Stewart assumes duties from acting director David Shedd. He had been serving as the commander of Marine Forces Cyber before the new assignment. </text>
