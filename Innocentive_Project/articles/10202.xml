  <text>The Battleship NORTH CAROLINA—the decommissioned USS North Carolina—invites the public to an onboard Halloween bash on October 30, 2012. The fun includes sweet treats, a petting zoo, temporary tattoos, caricatures and a bounce house, not to mention a chance to celebrate the holiday within a piece of classic U.S. military history.
	Located in Wilmington, North Carolina, the ship’s Halloween festivities begin at 5:30 p.m. and last until 8 p.m. The cost is $5 per person. Kids two years old or younger get in free.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s news editor.</text>
