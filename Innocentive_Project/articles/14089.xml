  <text>Huntington Ingalls Inc., Pascagoula, Mississippi, is being awarded a not-to-exceed $13,503,584 cost-plus-award-fee modification to previously awarded contract (N00024-12-C-2312) for DDG 51 class flight III upgrade design services. Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, is being awarded a $13,027,540 cost-plus-award-fee/cost-plus-fixed-fee modification to previously awarded contract (N00024-12-C-2313). The main goal of the flight III upgrade is to replace the SPY-1D(V) radar with the air and missile defense radar. This modification to the existing DDG 51 Class Lead Yard Services contract will allow for DDG 51 class flight III upgrade design efforts, along with procurement of design vendor furnished information in support of the flight III design. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.?
