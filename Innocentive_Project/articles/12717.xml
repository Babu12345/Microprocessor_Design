  <text>Few things are more frustrating than contacting big companies to reach customer service. If you can make it through the phone maze and beat the robotic menus to reach an actual human, they will likely transfer you a few more times for good measureâ€”forcing you to repeat your question or complaint. The GetHuman app promises to make the process less painful by providing the best phone number or email address to bypass the usual frustrations.
	The app identifies the fastest sequence through a company's tangled web of options, so you don't have to wait on hold or have someone call you back. From your phone company to your cable provider, the app includes contact information for thousands of companies worldwide.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play, or purchase the iOS or Android pro version for $0.99, which does not have ads.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
