  <text>Homefront Help has its own Facebook page and anyone interested in supporting the military community is invited to "like" the page and share thoughts and ideas. In addition to posting the items covered in this monthly column, the page includes time-sensitive announcements and information about upcoming events. All groups that offer assistance to the military community are encouraged to use the resource as a forum to pass the word about activities; more casual visitors can mention useful programs they know. Those who have received help from organizations are welcome to share their experiences so others can benefit as well. This is also a great place for suggestions that could further the effort to give U.S. service members, veterans and their families the thanks and support they deserve.</text>
