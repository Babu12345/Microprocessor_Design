  <text>BAE Systems, Arlington, Virginia, is being awarded about $11 million to develop airborne processing and sensor system hardware and software, including storage for real-time on-board detection and tracking of large numbers-20,000-plus-of dismounts and vehicles over a wide area. It will integrate the tracker with the Wide Area Motion Imaging (WAMI) sensor as well as communications links to the ground station and will develop storage, chipping, dissemination, and processing control. Ground processing software will also be developed to support exploitation of WAMI downlink video and ancillary data. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
