  <text>MBDA has received a contract worth over £300 million ($465 million) from the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) that ensures the Royal Air Force remains equipped with the infrared guided air-to-air missile, ASRAAM. The contract covers the supply of new missiles to refresh the existing inventory. The missiles will be produced at MBDA’s new Bolton manufacturing and assembly site that will be commissioned in mid-2016. The engineering activities are being carried out at MBDA sites in Stevenage and Bristol.
