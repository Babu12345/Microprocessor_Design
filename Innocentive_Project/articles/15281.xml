  <text>?Systems &amp; Technology Research, Woburn, Massachusetts, has been awarded a $7,247,502 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development. Contractor will work to dramatically improve the ability to detect and geolocate high frequency emitters. The previous phase, Phase 1 of the program, addressed technical innovations to accomplish this objective, including the ability to accurately resolve multiple angles-of-arrival and polarization states through novel antenna concepts; the ability to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and signal detection through the use of multi-dimensional adaptive signal processing; and the ability to accurately determine the dynamic state of the ionosphere. Phase 2 includes system integration of these innovations followed by a non-real-time field test. Phase 3 will be real-time implementation and demonstration with field testing. Work will be performed at Woburn, Massachusetts, and is expected to be complete by August 29, 2018. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with seven offers received. Fiscal 2014 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $2 million are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-15-C-9105).</text>
