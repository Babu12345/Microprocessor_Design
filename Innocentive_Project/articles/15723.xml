  <text>Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, St. Petersburg, Florida, is being awarded an $11,410,990 modification to a previously awarded contract (N00024-13-C-5230) to exercise an option to provide engineering development model build and test for the cooperative engagement capability (CEC) common array block family of antennae. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple or layered engagement strategies. Work will be performed in St. Petersburg, Florida (40 percent); McKinney, Texas (28 percent); Largo, Florida (22 percent); and Andover, Massachusetts (10 percent), and is expected to be completed by August 2017. Fiscal 2016 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funding in the amount of $5,000,000 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of fiscal 2016. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity.</text>
