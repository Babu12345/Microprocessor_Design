  <text>All right veterans, spruce up those résumés and get ready to search for jobs. America Wants You is a portion of CareerBuilder.com dedicated exclusively to helping veterans find employment. Former military members can search through the posted job listings to find a desirable position; thousands of available opportunities currently are posted. Media campaigns are in place to encourage employers and potential employees to take advantage of the offerings, creating a market that benefits all parties. As part of the campaign, celebrities have recorded video messages urging companies to hire veterans.   Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
