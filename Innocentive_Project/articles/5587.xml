  <text>Verizon Business and Nortel have reached a three-year agreement in which Nortel will evolve its traditional voice system to Verizon Internet Protocol (IP) Trunking VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) service, which is based on session initiation protocol. In addition, Verizon Business will manage Nortel's existing Verizon Private IP network, enabling Nortel to benefit from expanded managed network service capabilities and industry-leading service level agreements.
