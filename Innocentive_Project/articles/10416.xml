Kanawha County, W.Va., Metro Emergency Operations Center (Metro 911) is implementing New World Systems' Aegis Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) solution to improve emergency response through integrated mapping and automated dispatch tools. New World's CAD will allow Metro 911 to leverage Kanawha County's geographic information systems data to help dispatchers quickly locate emergencies and send the closest first responders. It also will save significant time for dispatchers with easy-to-use screens and more instant access to information. Covering a geographic area of 911 square miles, Metro 911 receives more calls for service than any other county in West Virginia. New World's CAD, built on the Microsoft platform with embedded mapping, will help Metro 911 better serve a population of more than 200,000 residents.</text>
