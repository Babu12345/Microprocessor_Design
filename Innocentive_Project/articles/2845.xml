  <text>When I was a kid, my dad made good money during the very early 1970s, which had a particularly poor-performing stock market.  I grew up believing that even during a recession… certain things actually go up.  I’m talking about the thrifty stocks that reflect more consumers were trying to save money.  One such category was aftermarket parts for cars.  Why? Because more consumers were fixing their car themselves, vice buying a new car or sending it to the mechanic at $150 per hour for repairs. If you get this idea and agree, then you will understand the modeling, simulation and training market right now.  This triad niche is a huge market that has an annual conference named Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, Education Conference (I/ITSEC) in the capital city for such technologies, Orlando, Florida.  Every late November thousands of professionals converge on the convention center in Orange County as they did this year.  Why was it a record attendance for I/ITSEC?  Because during budget cuts, it’s a lot cheaper to simulate the use of a fighter jet then it is to actually fly one.  With fuel costs only going up over time, I don’t see the trend reversing. Discussion:  What else is going up during a recession and times of a budget cut?  </text>
