  <text>QinetiQ North America Inc., Waltham, Massacusetts, has been awarded a maximum $7,750,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the Battlefield Air Targeting Man-Aided Knowledge II (BATMAN II)-Advanced Technology Demonstration Program, and a $218,128 cost-plus-fixed-fee task order for BATMAN II. The BATMAN II program is designed to focus on advancing technologies relevant to the special operators of the Air Force. The complex nature of the ground operations conducted by battlefield airmen require advanced technologies to reduce fatigue and workload in austere environments, increase mission effectiveness, reduce tactical decision making time and errors, and enhance situational awareness. The technologies developed under the BATMAN II program will focus on accelerating the development, demonstration, and assessment timeline of critical mission capabilities. Air Force Research Laboratory, Human Effectiveness-Biosciences Protection Contracting, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-14-D-6529 and Task Order 0001).</text>
