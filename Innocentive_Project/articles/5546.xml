  <text>Harris Corporation has been awarded an eight-month study contract by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, to develop a new modular communications architecture for satellites that weigh less than 400 kilograms and can be deployed quickly and cost-effectively. The study will support the Operationally Responsive Space Office at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, with systems engineering, requirements analysis and concept development of an architecture whereby common components are able to support multiple payloads. </text>
