  <text>Raytheon Co., McKinney, Texas, is being awarded an $8,977,748 modification to previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract (N00164-12-G-JQ66) for common sensor payload (CSP) AN/AAS-53 high-definition retrofits. CSP AN/AAS-53 high-definition retrofits, while functioning on manned or unmanned aircraft, provide battlefield commanders with a day/night imaging sensor and laser designator for reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and target designation. The payload must operate day and night, detect and recognize operationally-meaningful targets at survivable standoff ranges, determine range-to-target, auto track and designate targets for precision-guided standoff weapons, provide target-location coordinates, and display continuous high-resolution imagery to the battlefield commander. The ability to provide such a capability to the supported commander will greatly increase battlefield effectiveness. The CSP high-definition will have adequate on-board processing to perform auto tracking, designation, and to support the transmission of near-real-time motion imagery. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Ind., is the contracting activity.Â </text>
