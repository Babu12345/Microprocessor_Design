  <text>The U.S. Army awarded a contract to General Dynamics C4 Systems, Scottsdale, Ariz., for 10 vehicle-mounted Tactical Ground Station Lot D systems with an option for 11 additional systems. The TGS system is part of the Distributed Common Ground System-Army, the Army’s primary deployed system for posting, processing and distributing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance  information in real time to intelligence analysts and commanders. The order is valued at $31.5 million with all options exercised. The first of the new TGS systems is scheduled for delivery during the third quarter of 2013. </text>
