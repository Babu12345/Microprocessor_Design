  <text>Hotels for Heroes offers free hotel rooms to wounded, injured and ill service members who are undergoing treatment at military or Veterans Affairs medical centers or who need to attend certain events. Administered by the Fisher House Foundation—an organization long known for providing accommodations and support to military families—the program provides its rooms through hotel-point donations from individuals. It's the perfect opportunity to combine point numbers too small for a free stay with donations from others. All requests for rooms received by Hotels for Heroes are vetted through authorized officials. Troops eligible for the lodging cannot receive government-funded reimbursement for their stays. In some cases, military families or close friends can use the accommodations to visit their military loved ones who are receiving medical care. More information, including participating hotel chains, is available in the program's fact sheet. As a bonus, people who donate their points can sleep more soundly, wherever they lay their head, knowing they've helped a good program assist deserving people.
Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
