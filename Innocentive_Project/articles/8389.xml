  <text>This Android app uses a smart keyboard to predict and personalize messages based on your individual writing style and vocabulary. 

The SwiftKey X app, developed by TouchType Ltd., replaces the standard Android keyboard with one powered by the Fluency artificial intelligence engine, which learns from the user and offers corrections and next word predictions. The program gets more accurate over time by monitoring typing patterns and word use on Google, Facebook and Twitter accounts along with text messages.

The app predicts nearly 84 percent of words within two or fewer characters. In addition, it can predict one-third of next words without any character entry at all, and it corrects typing errors as you go. For those who speak more than one language, the keyboard allows for text entry in two languages simultaneously.

Download the app for $4.00 in the Android Market.
