Insitu Inc., Bingen, Wash., is being awarded an $8,528,000 firm-fixed-price delivery order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement (N00019-12-G-0008) to address hardware obsolescence issues and align two previously delivered early operational capability RQ-21A small tactical unmanned aircraft systems to the current system configuration. This delivery order provides for hardware upgrades as well as field service representatives and instructors to ensure a seamless transition. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Md., is the contracting activity. </text>
