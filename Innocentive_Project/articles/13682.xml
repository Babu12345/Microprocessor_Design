  <text>Reginald Brothers, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) undersecretary for science and technology, today announced the new visionary goals for the department’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate.

The goals include noninvasive “screening at speed” to scan people, baggage or cargo while respecting privacy, with minimal impact to the pace of travel and speed of commerce; a trusted cyber future that protects privacy, commerce and community, which includes an underlying digital infrastructure that will be self-detecting, self-protecting and self-healing; actionable information at the speed of thought, including predictive analytics, risk analysis and modeling-and-simulation systems that will enable critical and proactive decisions to be made based on the most relevant information, transforming data into actionable information; responders who are threat-adaptive and cross-functional, armed with comprehensive physical protection, interoperable tools and networked threat detection and mitigation capabilities; and a critical infrastructure designed, built and maintained to withstand naturally occurring and man-made disasters.
