  <text>Election day will be here before we know it, and the free PollTracker app for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad puts the latest data in the palm of your hand.
PollTracker, created by TPM Media, provides tools to track the 2012 election in real time and presents the results in a graphic interface. From the presidency to seats in Congress, the app content covers every race.
Top features include: a curated list of the latest polls in the nation’s most heated races; swing state averages; breakdowns of key voting blocks; candidate information; historical charting of the race; a search function; and push notifications for new polls.
Forbes named it one of the “5 Essential Mobile Apps for Election Season.”
Download the free app from the iTunes App Store.
