  <abstract>By enrolling in My Soldier, participants adopt deployed service members provided by the program and agree to send them periodic upbeat letters or e-mail messages. Care packages also can be sent but are not required. After enrolling, participants can download a My Soldier Starter Kit that contains instructions on how to begin the process as well as letter-writing guidelines.</abstract>
  <text>Updated on 1/15/10: The My Soldier program is no longer operational; however, for those who are still interested in supporting the troops through letters and care packages, another excellent option is the Adopt a U.S. Soldier program. The Adopt a U.S. Soldier organization allows citizens to support troops by sending e-mails, letters and packages. You can obtain more information and register for the program at http://www.adoptaussoldier.org/preregistration.htm. The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
