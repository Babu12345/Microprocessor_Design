  <text>A huge chasm exists between cyber operators and the technical community, declared Brig Gen. Brett Williams, USAF, Pacific Command J-6. Both sides must learn the other's language if operators are to receive the systems that they actually need, he offered. Speaking in the Thursday panel at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2010, Gen. Williams related that operators often do not understand the technical language of the systems that are being designed for them. As a result, they are not able to effectively input design advice, and often are faced with the challenge of adapting a system to suit their needs. Conversely, technicians often do not fully understand operators' needs, he added. Both need to reach out to the other group to begin system design with a better understanding of everyone's points of view. For operators, Gen. Williams suggested that they learn about cyber systems in the same manner that pilots learn about their aircraft before they set foot in them to fly. Going even further was Rear Adm. William E. Leigher, USN, deputy commander, U.S. Fleet Cyber Command/10th Fleet. He suggested the creation of a cyber acquisition force, because characteristics of cyberspace are greatly different than those of the platform world, especially the pace of change. He noted that the military buys carriers from a limited number of shipyards, but it buys information technology from many sources, which calls for a new way of doing business.</text>
