  <text>Returning Heroes Home offers a place for wounded warriors and their families at the San Antonio Military Medical Center burn unit and the Center for the Intrepid to recover, rest and find support. The building is the new location of the Warrior and Family Support Center and provides a "living room" environment so the injured troops and their loved ones can enjoy the comforts of home during treatment. Phase one raised money to build the facility; the organization now is looking for funds to help complete the second phase, which involves creating a therapeutic garden and recreation area to further enhance healing efforts. The garden is designed to accommodate the unique needs of burn patients. Returning Heroes Home hopes to complete the outside area by the end of this year. Donations can be made through the website, and more information also is available online.</text>
