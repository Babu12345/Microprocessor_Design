The Falcon III AN/PRC-117G(C) is the first wideband networking radio to utilize the Software Communication Architecture (SCA) and receive NSA Type-1 certification for the protection of voice and data traffic up through the TOP SECRET level. First deliveries will be made immediately. The Falcon III AN/PRC-117G(C) is a manpack companion radio to the JTRS-approved Falcon III AN/PRC-152(C) multiband handheld and AN/VRC-110 vehicular radios. The Falcon III family of software-defined tactical communication equipment is designed to advance the U.S. military's vision of network-centric warfare. Background on the Falcon III AN/PRC-117G(C)The Falcon III AN/PRC-117G(C) was specifically designed to host advanced government waveforms. The radio currently incorporates the Harris Advanced Networking Wideband Waveform (ANW2) for mobile ad-hoc networking. The ANW2 networking waveform provides secure IP data to the tactical Internet at on-air rates up to 10 Megabits per second (Mbps). This high data rate-joined with mobile ad-hoc networking, automated network establishment and maintenance, and integrated security-provides a powerful networking solution. In addition, the AN/PRC-117G(C) and its software-defined architecture offers interoperability with currently fielded radios, incorporating SINCGARS, Havequick II, and the High Performance Waveform (HPW), as well as MIL-STD-181B Tactical Satellite (TACSAT) capability. The AN/PRC-117G(C) also utilizes the Harris Sierra II software-programmable encryption module, a reprogrammable cryptographic device that can be embedded in a variety of voice and data products for protection of information up to the TOP SECRET level. Sierra™ II is the cryptographic engine for several U.S. Type-1 radios, including the AN/PRC-152(C) multiband handheld radio. Falcon III radios offer a 30 MHz to 2 GHz frequency range, an SCA-operating environment, significant processing power, and the ability to accommodate new waveforms for networking, TACSAT, commercial L-Band satellite, and public safety interoperability.

Polices converged traffic segments to assure that the high priority traffic gets through to its destination. Allows low priority traffic to make use of additional bandwidth availability when higher priority traffic doesn’t need the bandwidth Allows multiple traffic streams (both IPv4 and IPv6) to ride the same transport without the complexity or lost throughput of VPN or additional HAIPE devices. Minimizes the jitter across a network resulting in much higher voice quality (secure and non-secure) and higher secure call completion rates. Converts an aggregated IP uplink into a serial format for processing by NSA-approved type 1 Transec devices and back to Ethernet for transmission across an IP transport. The PacketAssure Service Delivery Manager keeps voice sounding like voice, video looking like video and synchronous data over IP synchronized, regardless of what other users are doing on the network. For more information, contact Ultra Electronics-DNE Technologies at (203) 265-7151, Toll-Free at (800) 370-4485 or visit them on the web at www.ultra-dne.com/transition   </text>
