  <abstract>SIGNAL Magazine has won three APEX 2009 Awards for Publication Excellence.</abstract>
  <text>SIGNAL Magazine has won its share of awards over the years, and all of its staffers justifiably have taken pride in their accomplishments. Usually, these awards have consisted of a single annual recognition for an article, a report or a graphic layout. This year, however, SIGNAL was blessed with separate awards for several endeavors. The magazine has won three APEX 2009 Awards for Publication Excellence. Executive Editor Maryann Lawlor won an award in the Newswriting category for her article, "Morphing Robot Under Development" (December 2008, page 61). Editor in Chief Robert K. Ackerman won in the Scientific and Environmental Writing category for the article, Computer Researchers Look Past Silicon (June 2008, page 39). And, New Media Editor Helen Mosher won in the Blogs, Wikis and Forums category for the SIGNAL Scape blog, which she originated.
