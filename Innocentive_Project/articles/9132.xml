  <abstract>All applications for the $1,500 scholarships must be received at a commissary location by Feb. 24.</abstract>
  <text>The hard-and-fast, no-exceptions deadline to apply for the Scholarships for Military Children Program is fast approaching. All applications must be received at eligible military commissaries by February 24. At least one $1,500 scholarship will be awarded at each commissary location where qualified applications are received. More than one scholarship may be handed out depending on response and funding. Recipients can use the awards for tuition, books, lab fees and other education-related expenses. 

Children of active duty, Reserve, Guard or retired military commissary customers can apply for the scholarships. Recipients must be enrolled or planning to enroll full-time in a four-year undergraduate college or university accredited in the U. S. and have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 basis. For complete rules and requirements, visit the program's website.

The scholarships are funded primarily through companies who sell goods at commissaries.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
