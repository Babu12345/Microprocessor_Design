  <text>Modern Technology Solutions Inc. (MTSI), Alexandria, Virginia, is being awarded a maximum $25,472,255 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for modeling, simulation, algorithms and analysis techniques for Missile Defense Concept and Technology Development. This contract provides for development of foundational models, algorithms and data sets in areas critical to high-fidelity, closed-loop (HFCL) simulations of future sensors and interceptors including flight sciences, sensors, communications, algorithms, phenomenology and lethality. MTSI will develop HFCL simulations for the broad portfolio of future sensor and interceptor concepts. New models, algorithms and data sets will be integrated into simulations of interceptors, electro optical/infrared and radio frequency sensors. An additional capability will be provided to integrate these into a system of systems construct to represent the Ballistic Missile Defense System. The Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, Alabama, is the contracting activity (HQ0147-14-D-0003).</text>
