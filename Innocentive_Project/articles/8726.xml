  <text>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, is being awarded a $39 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to utilize the Comprehensive National Incident Management System. This effort will explore, develop, and incorporate methods to combine simulation-generated expectations with evidence from individual noisy and sparse sensor or surveillance information sources, increasing the classification sensitivity of a sensor/surveillance suite; and take complex system state estimates as inputs and support human mediated and/or automatic context-based system-management decision making. This effort will also use high-performance computing and modeling technologies to represent large-scale socio-technological systems; adapt newly emerging technologies and investigate new methods, when necessary, to achieve the desired level of analytical capability; and support reachback, combatant commands, local, state, and first responders. This was a sole-source procurement. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, is the contracting activity.</text>
