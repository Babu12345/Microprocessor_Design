C2UK Ltd. and Mutualink Incorporated partnered to further develop and circulate the communications-based product portfolio. Overseas, C2UK will leverage the state-of-the-art, secure communications and information-sharing technology, expanding the companies’ global reach, particularly of command and control (C2) systems.

Part of Mutalink’s portfolio includes the Operations Fusion Kit 2.0, a multimedia communications system bundled into a compact, lightweight, waterproof, ruggedized Pelican carrying case that enables secure voice, full-motion video and information sharing on a global, real-time basis.

C2UK, based in the United Kingdom, is an engineering business specializing in the design, production and integration of C2 and sophisticated communications systems.
