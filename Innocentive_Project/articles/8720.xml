  <text>Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems Corporation, San Diego, California; Rockwell Collins Incorporated, Government Systems, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Raytheon Company, Space and Airborne Systems, El Segundo, California, are each being awarded a $47 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for the Trinity Program, which seeks to develop a "navigation warfare sensor" that could replace traditional Global Positioning System receivers on a variety of Department of Defense platforms, resulting in a significant increase in the number of future weapon systems operating in highly challenged electromagnetic environments, having the capability to support electronic support operations as a part of planned missions. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
