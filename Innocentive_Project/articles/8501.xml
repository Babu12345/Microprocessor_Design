  <abstract>The U.S. Army has linked military radios and chat systems with cell phones, instant messaging and other commercial products that can facilitate communications among the U.S. military and NATO allies. Using Lync 2010, a Microsoft collaboration product, the capability will enable warfighters in command posts or on patrol to know who is online and the best way to reach them-either by computer, radio, chat or phone.</abstract>
  <text>The U.S. Army has linked military radios and chat systems with cell phones, instant messaging and other commercial products that can facilitate communications among the U.S. military and NATO allies. Using Lync 2010, a Microsoft collaboration product, the capability will enable warfighters in command posts or on patrol to know who is online and the best way to reach them-either by computer, radio, chat or phone. Although in the prototype stage, the multi-option communications have been connected via the Lync-Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 in combination with the Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below Blue Force Tracking. Lync also enables single-channel ground and airborne radio system radio, cell phone and VoIP voice communications. Text-based communications occur via the Universal Collaboration Bridge Army engineers developed.</text>
