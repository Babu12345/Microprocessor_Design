  <text>The Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise, or ICITE, will link to the Defense Department’s Joint Information Environment (JIE) via a bridge architecture. The Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E) will ensure that the community-specific ICITE and the defensewide JIE can coexist.
	Al Tarasiuk, chief information officer, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, described the DI2E to a luncheon audience on the second day of AFCEA’s three-day JIE Mission Partner Symposium being held in Baltimore May 12-14. It will ensure the needs of the intelligence community that are resident in ICITE will not be compromised by access to the JIE. Similarly, both environments will be able to interoperate and reap the benefits for which they are designed.
	Tarasiuk allowed that the community is working with many groups in this effort. Many new partnerships have been generated, including some with commercial off-the-shelf providers.</text>
