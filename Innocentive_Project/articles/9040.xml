  <text>Prepare for your next business trip with the click of a button. The Yelp app transforms your smartphone into a mobile tour guide by helping you locate the best places to visit. The free program lets you search for nearby businesses, and it includes quick links to find nearby bars, restaurants, gas stations and more. Browse reviews and find the best spots in your city. In addition, the app includes deals offered by local businesses. Use the program to enhance your knowledge of the neighborhood surrounding your next event. Get a sneak peak at San Diego's historic Gaslamp Quarter before the AFCEA/U.S. Naval Institute West conference this month. Download the free app for iPhone, Android or BlackBerry, or access the mobile website on any device. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
