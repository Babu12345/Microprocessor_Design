  <text>NEXGEN Communications LLC, Dulles, Virginia, has been awarded an $8,432,040 cost-plus-fixed-fee completion contract for Miniaturized Receiver Transmitter (mRXTX) Prototype Modules. Contractor will develop and demonstrate a miniaturized Radio Frequency (RF) transmit/receive module to support Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) requirements. The CLASS program requires an integrated transmit and receive module capable of performing wideband self-filtering for frequency division duplexing with high dynamic range and efficiency, which this effort will provide. The scope of this effort encompasses the innovation, design, assembly and assessment of a miniaturized RF transmit/receive module. The fabrication of the receive module, and then the integration of transmit and receive modules, will be performed. Each module/assembly will be thoroughly tested and reported. Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, New York, is the contracting activity (FA8750-14-C-0123).</text>
