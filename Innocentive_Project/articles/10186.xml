  <text>The U.S. Army’s Project Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PM UAS) is partnering with academic institutions to build on lessons learned in combat. Officials aim to advance the operational understanding of UAS technologies and explore a range of rapidly expanding uses for them, including within U.S. airspace. For example, unmanned aerial vehicles could be used in disaster response and humanitarian relief efforts as well as environmental and law enforcement initiatives. For some projects, the agreements will enable students to visit U.S. Defense Department laboratories at Redstone Arsenal.
The research will examine the mechanics of UAS flight as well as sensor technology application and interoperability issues. In addition, the program could result in schools standing up UAS curriculums. Most recently, the PM UAS set up a collaborative memorandum of understanding with Middle Tennessee State University designed to promote independent research of development, deployment, tactics, techniques and procedures for the systems. Other agreements are in place with Mississippi State, Alabama A&amp;M and Auburn universities.
