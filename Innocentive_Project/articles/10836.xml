  <text>Raytheon Co., Tucson, Ariz., is being awarded an $8,761,875 modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract for the replacement of the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Encoder due to obsolescence issues for the Tomahawk Missile. The PCM Encoder is a key component of the Mid-Body Range Safety Subsystem kit, which is installed into flight test configured missiles. The PCM Encoder samples the flight test missile guidance and avionics telemetry data stream, encodes and formats the data, and provides the telemetry information to the ground monitoring station. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Md. is the contracting activity.</text>
