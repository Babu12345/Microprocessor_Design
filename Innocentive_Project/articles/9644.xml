  <text>The Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAM) offers 12 months of training assistance in high-demand occupations to veterans who meet certain criteria regarding age, employment and compensation. From July through September, the program can accept 45,000 participants. Between October and March 2013, 54,000 participants can qualify. The monthly full payment rate currently is set at $1,473 per month. The U.S. Department of Labor will offer employment assistance to every participating veteran upon completion of training.

The program already is accepting applications. Additional information about requirements is available on the VRAM website.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
