  <text>Raytheon Company, Los Angeles, California, has been chosen by Los Angeles County to replace legacy emergency dispatch consoles with new ones that can easily be expanded for emerging public safety technologies such as Long Term Evolution, a high-speed, wireless broadband data network. Under a $12.5 million contract, Raytheon will replace all public safety communications consoles for the sheriff and fire departments. When the twin-screen consoles are in place, public safety dispatchers can see which units are available and have the shortest response time in handling both routine and emergency incidents. The changes will also provide increased interoperability between jurisdictions.</text>
