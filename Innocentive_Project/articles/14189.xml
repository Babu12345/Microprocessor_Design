  <text>The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday ended its stalemate and voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security though the end of the fiscal year in September. The vote means the department avoids a shutdown and the furloughing of staff members.

Lawmakers voted 257-167, with most Republicans voting against the bill. The Senate had passed its version of a clean bill last week. President Barack Obama is expected to sign it.

At issue was a mostly Republican-led disagreement over the White House’s controversial immigration order to grant temporary work permits to an estimated five million immigrants who entered the United States illegally.  The bill passed Tuesday carries no immigration provisions. 

Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) posted a message on Twitter, thanking "the 182 House Democrats and 75 Republicans for ending this self-inflicted crisis."

Though the standoff will go down as a win for Democrats, lawmakers opposed to the immigration provisions vowed to fight on. "We're here because the president of the United States violated the constitutional separation of powers," said Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC). "Regardless of how you feel about immigration, immigration reform or even amnesty, surely you believe in the United States Constitution that you swore an oath to. ... It really has nothing to to do with [the] DHS funding, amnesty or immigration. That's the vehicle we're using, sure, but it has everything to do with the United States Constitution." </text>
