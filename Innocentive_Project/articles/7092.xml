  <text>ITT Integrated Electronic Warfare Systems, Raytheon Electronic Warfare Systems, Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems, and BAE Electronic Integration Systems each received approximately $42 million for technology maturation efforts in support of the next-generation jammer, which will replace the ALQ-99 tactical jamming system.Â  Technology maturation efforts include research in support of future development of airborne electronic attack capability from a tactical-size airborne stand-off/mod-escort platform. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity. Awards varied slightly with ITT receiving $42.4 million, Raytheon $41.98 million, Northrop Grumman $41.97 million and BAE $41.7 million.</text>
