  <text>Thales, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, has been awarded a £19 million ($26,527,677) contract by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defensce to perform a midlife update to the External Communications Voice Distribution and Management System (KMY) for the Royal Navy Type 23 frigate fleet. The KMY Replacement System (KRS) will replace the present analog KMY communications system with a fully digital solution, and it will serve the Type 23 platform until it is replaced by the Type 26 frigate. KRS is the first phase of the fleetwide Project Calliope, which will progressively update the majority of terrestrial communications systems fitted across the Royal Navy surface fleet and some Royal Fleet Auxiliary platforms.
