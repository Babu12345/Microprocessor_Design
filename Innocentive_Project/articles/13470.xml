  <text>Driving somewhere unfamiliar and in need of a gas station? Starving but not sure which restaurants are nearby? The free AroundMe app for iOS and Android identifies your location and shows you a complete list of nearby businesses in the category you select. Find a restaurant, movie theater, gas station, hotel, hospital, bank, bar, grocery store and more.

For each listing, you can view the location on a map and the best route with step-by-step GPS directions. Add the information to your contact list or email it to a friend.

You can use the app whether you're close to home or across the globe on a trip. It's available in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Chinese.

Download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
