  <text>The Veterans Charity Challenge  is giving away $100,000 to charities that support the military community. But that’s only the beginning. Because of the way the contest is set up, participating groups will raise other money for their causes along the way, resulting in higher contribution totals. Here’s how it works.Craigconnects and The Rahr Foundation are celebrating the former’s two-year anniversary by awarding monetary prizes to fundraising teams that bring in the most donations between noon Eastern on May 23 and July 3. In addition to the top three overall prizes of $35,000, $25,000 and $15,000, an additional $25,000 will be given to charities throughout the campaign as weekly Bonus Challenges. Donors can win prizes along the way, too.
	Everyone can participate in the Veterans Charity Challenge by registering a fundraising page on CrowdRise and collecting for U.S.-based 501(c)3s with missions that benefit veterans’ causes and military families. People who want to take part can join an existing team, create their own team or donate online. Download the complete rules for more details.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s senior news editor.</text>
