  <text>Northrop Grumman Cobham Intercoms LLC (NGCI), a company formed by Northrop Grumman Corporation and Cobham, has reinstated a 10-year, $2.4 billion contract awarded in June 2008 by the U.S. Army to produce the Vehicular Intercommunication System Expanded (VIS-X). The contract was delayed by a losing bidder protest filed with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO denied the protest and the contract will now progress with NGCI as the selected supplier.</text>
