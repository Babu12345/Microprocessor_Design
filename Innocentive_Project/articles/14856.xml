  <text>The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) today announced a $2.9 million cybersecurity mobile app security research and development award that will help identify mobile app vulnerabilities. The Northern Virginia-based small business, Kryptowire, was awarded a 30-month contract through the S&amp;T’s Long Range Broad Agency Announcement.

The project aims to establish continuous automated assurance of mobile apps for the federal government. By combining mobile app archiving and app vetting technologies as well as incorporating government and industry security standards, the project will capture app changes made over the app’s lifespan and will test against known vulnerabilities and emerging threats. The results captured will be put into a report that is continuously maintained and will follow the Federal Chief Information Officer Council’s Mobile Technology Tiger Team initiative for app reciprocity reporting that would be shareable to other federal departments and agencies.

S&amp;T’s Cyber Security Division and First Responders Group are leading this effort with partnerships from the Department’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Computer Emergency Readiness Team, as well as the Department of Justice, U.S. General Services Administration and other federal agencies.</text>
