  <text>ITT Corporation, Roanoke, Virginia, is being awarded about $36 million for AN/AVS-9, night vision image intensifier sets. The AN/AVS-9 system is a night vision system consisting of a binocular imaging assembly, a helmet mount, a low profile power pack, a carrying case, and ancillary equipment. The AN/AVS-9 is used by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps helicopters as a pilot's visual aid during night operations, low-level, and nape-of-the-earth flight. This system also provides imagery required for takeoff, landing, and hover as well as en-route flight. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity.</text>
