  <text>Critical Solutions International (CSI), Carrollton, Texas, announced today that the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) has selected its Intelligent Video Surveillance Solution to provide advanced video security at selected rail stations within the stateâ€™s rapid transit network. The Intelligent Video Surveillance Solution will provide enhanced security and safety for thousands of commuters, as well as first responders, while saving time and taxpayer money, the announcement says. The system notifies safety and security personnel of unusual events such as the intrusion of unauthorized areas, unattended luggage, or loitering. In addition the system stores digital video data that can be rapidly analyzed through customized searches.</text>
