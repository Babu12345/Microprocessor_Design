  <text>CPI CPI’s SuperLinear® TWTAs, including the 40 W Ka-band outdoor amplifier pictured, are designed for optimal operation at backoff power levels that are required in order to meet traditional international intermodulation specifications. This has resulted in a line of HPAs that is smaller, lighter and runs cooler than competing products.Most traditional high power amplifiers (HPAs) are designed to run from small signal to saturated power. In practice however, the true usable power in a typical uplink application is limited by linearity requirements set by Intelsat and other satellite organizations. Thus, while power backoff of 3 to 7 dB is all that is ever required, one still needs the top end peak power to avoid clipping of the transmitted signal. This clipping results in Intermodulation products, spectral regrowth, and other non-linearities. Operating power must be limited to a maximum –3 dB from the maximum peak power for low bit-error rates when transmitting QPSK, QAM, CDMA, and OFDM signals.The TWT, linearizer and HPA can be optimized to work best at the 3 dB backoff point (half average power). This results in a more efficient amplifier at the true operating point. Internal TWT and amplifier temperatures are reduced, required amplifier prime power is minimized, and HPA size and weight are dramatically reduced.A comparison of the specifications of CPI’s SuperLinear Ka-band TWTA against those of the traditional TWTA (non-optimized and non-linearized) shows a 20% reduction in size and a 44% reduction in weight, as well as a 50% reduction in prime power consumption. This amplifier even compares favorably against the industry’s leading SSPAs, which are only able to provide half as much linear power – for twice as much linear RF, the TWTA weighs a few pounds less and is only 22% larger. Further, the prime power is typically 40% less.Finally, it is worth noting that much has been said in the industry about the relative reliability of TWTAs and SSPAs. SuperLinear TWTAs, given their high efficiency, run much cooler than traditional TWTAs and SSPAs, resulting in an environment that is much easier on electronic parts. The Ka-band SuperLinear TWTA boasts a Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) figure of over 70,000 hours.

Codan’s encryptor supports 256-bit AES encryption with integrated MELPe (Mixed Excitation Linear Predictive enhanced) digital voice. “Codan’s NATO STANAG 4591 MELPe 1200/2400 b/s digital voice also provides a significant improvement in voice quality, vital for mission critical calls, and enables good quality digital voice versus traditional techniques typically used in harsh noisy environments,” said Greg Bell, general manager, HF Military &amp; Security Division, Codan Limited. Codan was recently awarded its first contract incorporating the DV AES-256 Encryptor by a European Partnership for Peace (PfP) customer.All programming of Codan’s DV AES-256 Encryptor can be achieved via the handset or front panel of the transceiver. Codan also provides a PC (Windows™) based Key Management Software (KMS) as a convenient alternative. Supporting programming of the 256-bit AES encryption, 128-bit CES encryption and frequency hopping keys, this allows for a central point of management and distribution of encryption keys. The system encrypts the key set files for additional security, providing the ability, if desired, to only be opened and edited on one computer. For distribution, the Key Fill Software (KFS), which operates from a PC or PDA (Windows Mobile™), can be used for programming. Transceiver information provided in KMS can then be used to program designated transceivers only by matching their electronic serial numbers.About CodanCodan Limited based in Adelaide, Australia, designs and manufactures a diversified product range for the international HF radio, satellite RF subsystem and digital metal detection markets. Over 80% of Codan’s annual revenue of $150+ million is derived from export markets. Codan, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009, has supplied more than 100,000 transceivers to over 150 countries, and has recently been named the Asia Pacific Tactical Military Communications Provider of the Year by Frost and Sullivan. Codan serves customers worldwide, including the US Department of Defense, Department of State, and civil authority segments within internal security, and has provided thousands of transceivers to support security and rebuilding programs worldwide.The Codan Military and Security Division focuses on providing affordable, reliable HF radio communications products and systems for worldwide defense and government organizations.  DHS Systems LLC DHS Systems LLC recently introduced the newest product to join its line of Deployable Command and Control Equipment (DC2E) – the DC2E Large Transformer Projection Screen Display. Designed to fit into a large tactical operations center (TOC), the DC2E Large Transformer Projection Screen Display features three DLP projectors that project on to three separate large, high resolution viewing areas that are more than 48” above the ground. The elevated viewing areas allow for images that are large enough and high enough to be viewed from the rear of a TOC. The new system can easily be configured for front or rear projection to maximize use of available workspace in either a softâ€walled shelter or hardened facility. Set up by four people in less than 30 minutes, the Large Transformer Projection Screen Display can be packed into four transportable cases. DRASH DC2E was created by DHS Systems as a solution to the information management issues facing today’s commander. Consisting of a projector system and various sized audio visual systems, DC2E provides lightweight, portable communications technology by merging multiple feeds of information onto single or multiple displays. Special features include touch panel control, diskless drive, high resolution image display and roundâ€theâ€clock operating capabilities. Since its introduction in 2005, more than 3,000 DRASH DC2E systems have been deployed throughout the world. DC2E products’ prices have recently been reduced and are easily accessible through gsaadvantage.gov by entering Contract #: GSâ€03Fâ€0181V. FEI-Zyfer   The NanoSync III from FEI-Zyfer is a compact, low power GPS referenced time and frequency module designed for customers who require a precise 1PPS and 10MHz reference in a small, ruggedized enclosure.  For authorized military customers, the NanoSync III is available with two SAASM GPS options.  The NanoSync III is well-suited for various military platforms supporting electronic warfare and other applications.  The NanoSync III SAASM comes equipped with either a GB-GRAM or MRU compliant SAASM receiver, easy-to-use key load connector, PLGR/DAGR port for hot start GPS acquisition and a zeroize switch.

For years now, up until just recently, our 200,000+ sq. ft. Chicagoland facility has been dedicated almost exclusively to the manufacturing of our flagship series of industrial ovens and equipment shelters. But as a metal fabricator, we are often asked by our customers to convert or modify existing products into something altogether different. Case in point – customized ISO shipping containers. Over the years we’ve  quietly modified ISO containers into many different products for our customers (power-generator enclosures, bunkhouses, communication shelters, guard houses, utility substations, etc.) The difference now is that we are actively promoting our customization services to a national audience. Our high quality custom fabrication work has not gone unnoticed in the industry and as a result, we are receiving some very high praise for the work we have done. Our success modifying ISO shipping containers has allowed us to focus our talents and resources towards developing comprehensive container solutions to serve all of our customers’ needs.
