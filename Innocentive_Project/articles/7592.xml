  <text>Integral Systems Incorporated recently announced that Avtec Systems, which now operates as part of Integral's Satellite Communications Solutions Divisions, has been awarded a $5 million contract to replace Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) multiplexers that are no longer sustainable at the U.S. military's largest test ranges. The contract was awarded as part of the Air Force Flight Test Center Range Data Acquisition Transport System program. Additional contract phases will replace ATM multiplexers at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Point Mugu Air Station and China Lake Naval Weapons Testing Center. During the contract's first phase, Integral Systems will install approximately 100 high-performance ioPLEX Access Gateways to the 412th Test Wing.</text>
