  <text>Teaming with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University, the APIC Corporation recently announced a scientific breakthrough that could lead to computer chips powered by light pulses rather than electronics. Photonic chips could offer greater performance at a small percentage of today's power usage. The team made germanium act as a laser, which means it could be used as the light source on a new generation of photon-powered computers. Photons use a fraction of the power currently needed and do not generate heat as electronic power, eliminating the current need to cool computers and data centers.</text>
