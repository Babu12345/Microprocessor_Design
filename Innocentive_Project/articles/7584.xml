  <abstract>Use Free App a Day to download apps for iPhone, iPad and Android. But hurry, the deals only last 24 hours.</abstract>
  <text>It may be the season for giving, but you'll be the one getting free apps every day with a popular site. Free App a Day offers daily freebies for iPhone, iPad and Android that usually cost $0.99 and up. Once an app gets listed on the site, you have just 24 hours to snag the deal. You can check the website for the latest finds or receive e-mail notifications based on categories of interest you select. For an even faster look at the free programs, follow the site's Twitter feed. If you're a developer and want your app featured on the site, it must go through a review process. Apps must meet certain quality standards, such as having at least 20 reviews and three stars in the app store. Blacksmith Games, OpenFeint, ICS Mobile and Tapjoy teamed up to launch the site. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
