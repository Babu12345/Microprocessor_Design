  <text>1st Detect Corporation recently announced that the Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in conjunction with U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway, Utah, has awarded a $735,000 Small Business Innovation Research Phase II contract to the company to design and develop a novel sample inlet system intended to significantly improve the sensitivity of mass spectrometers used for chemical detection in the field. The Phase II award enables the company to transition its proof of concept pre-concentrator into a field-testable prototype.</text>
