WriteRight provides synonyms, antonyms and phraseology, helping you choose the words that best fit your writing. The app’s powerful grammatical engine recognizes conjugated words, either feminine or plural, suggests synonyms and then replaces those words with their conjugated synonym counterparts, matching gender and number, person and tense. WriteRight also includes a customized Markdown keyboard, iCloud save and syncing and numerous exporting options.
 
Available for $2.99, the app even adapts to your linguistic knowledge level: school, college, university or business, helping you surpass your own limits. Download the app from the iTunes App Store.
