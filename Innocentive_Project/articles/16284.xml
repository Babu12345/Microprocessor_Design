  <text>Insitu Inc., Bingen, Washington, has been awarded a one-year indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract (H92222-16-D-0031) for Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems (MEUAS 1.5-B) intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services. The services will be provided worldwide, as specified in individual task orders. The period of performance is 12-months (six-month base period with two three-month options). This is a sole-source requirement and was issued under the authority 10 U.S. Code 2304(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. Justification and approval (J&amp;A) number 16-842 was signed on March 16, 2016. Fiscal 2016 operations and maintenance funds in the amount of $40,695,315 are being obligated at time of award. This undefinitized action is necessary to prevent interruption of ongoing services at multiple locations worldwide until a follow-on contract can be competitively awarded. This award action includes both firm-fixed-price and cost reimbursable line items. The redacted J&amp;A will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with FAR 6.305. The Special Operations Command, Tampa, Florida, is the contracting activity.</text>
