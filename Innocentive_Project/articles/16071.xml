  <text>Riverside Research Institute, New York, New York, has been awarded a $7,617,941 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development. Contractor will provide multi-model analog sensing to adaptively determine what features to compute from signals emitted by a device during training/testing, extracting sub-bands of interest, de-noising the individual signals and removing interfering transmissions by other devices in the vicinity. Work will be performed at New York, New York, and is expected to be complete by June 30, 2020. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with 45 offers received. Fiscal 2015 and 2016 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $2,065,771 are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-16-C-7624).</text>
