  <text>The U.S. Navy has awarded a $2.9 million contract to a team led by Lockheed Martin to continue development of an automated logistics system that will help Marines plan andÂ  re-evaluate missions based on real time battlefield data. In Phase II of the Sense and Respond Logistics program, Lockheed Martin and its partners will develop and refine the information architecture prototype designed and delivered to the Office of Naval Research under a Phase I contract. Phase II work will serve as the foundation for a decision support capability that will combine mission planning information with data from networked sensors on vehicles and other assets in the battlefield.</text>
