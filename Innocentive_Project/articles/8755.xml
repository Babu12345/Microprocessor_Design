  <text>General Dynamics C4 Systems has received a $12.7 million contract from the Australian Defence Force to provide AN/PRC-112G Global Positioning System-enabled search and rescue radios and accessories. Part of the HOOK2 System, the AN/PRC-112G radio sends encrypted global positioning information, user identification, situation reports and other critical information to combat search and rescue aircraft in short bursts to reduce the risk of detection and interception. Twenty-eight countries are now using HOOK2 radios for their combat search and rescue operations. The HOOK2 Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) system comprises the AN/PRC-112G radio, Quickdraw2 Interrogator and Satellite Communications Base Station, and allows downed air crews or isolated personnel to securely contact combat search and rescue resources over long distances. The radio is interoperable with satellite-based search and rescue systems, including the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme.</text>
