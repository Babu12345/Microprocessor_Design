  <abstract>The U.S. Army is expanding its intelligence activities both within its own forces and interoperably with the other services.</abstract>
  <text>U.S. Army intelligence is increasing its reach throughout the battlespace as it exploits new capabilities in support of its operations. New technologies and an increased focus on intelligence activities are the hallmark of the ground serviceâ€™s new approach to intelligence.

Lt. Gen. Mary Legere, USA, deputy chief of staff for intelligence (G-2), Headquarters, U.S. Army, described some of these efforts to the audience at the AFCEA/INSA Intelligence and National Security Summit 2014, held September 18-19 in Washington, D.C. Gen. Legere described an Army intelligence corps of 57,00 soldiers and civilians as a 15-year organization. Its multidiscipline intelligence allows for dealing with variety and change, she offered.

The general said the Army will be depending a great deal on medium-altitude intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). The service also invests a great deal in signals intelligence, she added. Army intelligence must have a forward presence at all times in its missions, but the service has less of a view on the ground than it had several years ago.

Army commanders now love intelligence personnel, the general offered. Combatant commands are requesting Army intelligence assistance to an increasing degree. And, a large Army intelligence element supports special operations.</text>
