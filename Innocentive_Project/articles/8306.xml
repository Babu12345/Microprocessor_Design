  <text>The contract for the Tiger Aircrew Training Means (TATM) has been extended by the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR 1) representing Germany and France. The four-year extension of the initial support contract which began in November 2006, will ensure the continued support and integrated services for the 26 Tiger helicopter simulators and associated devices located in four sites across France and Germany. The support activities within the contract include the daily servicing of the Tiger Aircrew Training Means, ensuring that the simulators are in the appropriate training configuration, and maintaining the simulators for effective operational use by the instructors.</text>
