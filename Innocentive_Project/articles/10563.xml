  <abstract>Critical Materials Institute to bring together researchers from academia, the private sector and four DOE national laboratories to find solutions that can be applied to a material’s life cycle and increase U.S. global competitiveness in the materials marketplace.</abstract>
  <text>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is investing $120 million over the next five years in an energy innovation hub. Called the Critical Materials Institute (CMI) and led by the Ames Laboratory, the hub will accommodate collaboration among scientists exploring advances in the development and commercialization of innovative clean energy technology. The CMI will bring together researchers from academia, the private sector and four DOE national laboratories to find solutions that can be applied to a material’s life cycle, including new ways to access sources of materials and innovative recycling and reuse ideas. The hub is the latest milestone of the Materials Genome Initiative, which focuses on accelerating the pace of the discovery and deployment of advanced material systems to support U.S. global competitiveness in the materials marketplace. A multiagency effort, the initiative was designed to create policy, resources and infrastructure that support U.S. institutions to discover, manufacture and deploy advanced materials twice as fast and at a fraction of today’s costs.</text>
