  <text>Elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment in Afghanistan are now using the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Rifleman Radio combined with the GD300 wearable computer. The radio enables intrasquad communications, and the GD300's Tactical Ground Reporting (TIGR) tactical app allows soldiers to share text messages, situation reports and other information. The Rifleman is part of the JTRS Handheld, Manpack, Small Form Fit radio family, which uses the Soldier Radio Waveform to provide networked voice and data communications in austere and cluttered urban environments. The GD300 touchscreen display enables users to place graphics and send maps to team members or leaders using the TIGR app. When combined, soldiers can use the equipment to display the position-location information of all other warfighters operating in the network. General Dynamics C4 Systems and General Dynamics Itronix developed the Rifleman Radio and GD300, respectively.</text>
