  <text>?Navatek Ltd., Honolulu, is being awarded a $6,942,667 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for new concepts and improved analytic methods for naval applications. The main objective of this effort is to develop capabilities for a Navatek-developed software simulation tool, AEGIR; enhancing the computational tools to produce more efficient computation solutions and more robust approaches to processing complex geometries; test and refine these new methods; and adapt these new methods to the Navy standard design environment. Work will be performed in Honolulu, and is expected to be completed by September 29, 2017. Fiscal 2015 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds in the amount of $4,139,541 are being obligated at the time of award. Funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured under Office of Naval Research broad agency announcement (BAA) 15-001. Since proposals will be received throughout the year under the long-range BAA, the number of proposals received in response to the solicitation is unknown. The Office of Naval Research, Arlington, Virginia, is the contracting activity (N00014-15-C-5158).</text>
