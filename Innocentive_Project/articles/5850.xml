  <text>Raytheon Company has been awarded a contract to develop the NextGen Terminal Data Distribution System (TDDS), which will make more efficient use of the crowded airspace in the U.S. The TDDS will automate flight information, resulting in improved capacity in the nation's airspace, and will facilitate the exchange of network-enabled data between disparate systems and integrate multiple data sources to better manage the airspace. Raytheon's Network Centric Systems leads the team, which includes Lockheed Martin's Transportation and Security Solutions Division, Intelligent Automation and Dnutch Associates.</text>
