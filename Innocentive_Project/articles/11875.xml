  <text>It's one of the first word processors made with mobile devices in mind. The free Quip app for the iPhone and iPad lets you create documents on the go while collaborating with others through the chat feature.
	Make lists, take notes, tackle a work project--the app makes it easy. Organize documents into folders and share them with your friends, family or co-workers. Every document has a chat thread, so you can edit together in real time.
	The app works offline and syncs when an Internet connection is available.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store. A "preview" version is available for Android and is intended for early adopters who already use the app on the Web and want to experiment with the pre-release. The functionality of this preview is limited. Check out Google Play for more details.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
