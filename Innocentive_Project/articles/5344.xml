  <text>IPL has signed a framework contract with Thales UK for the supply of software services. This framework has already led to IPL carrying out a significant amount of work on a Thales software radio program. This also will be for an ongoing development of a personal mobile radio, based on the Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) system. </text>
