  <text>Lockheed Martin, Colorado Springs, Colo., has announced it will continue supporting the air, space defense and missile warning missions for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Cheyenne Mountain Complex under a $20 million contract modification to the Integrated Space Command and Control (ISC2) program.Â Under this option, awarded by the U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Lockheed Martin will continue to sustain national defense missions at multiple locations worldwide. This is the second option exercised from the contract awarded in October 2012.</text>
