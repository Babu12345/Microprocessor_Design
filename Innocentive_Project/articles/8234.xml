  <text>Covia Labs Incorporated, Mountain View, California, recently announced that it has received a contract from the U.S Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate's Small Business Innovation Research program to research and develop public safety mobile broadband applications for mission critical voice communications. Under the contract, Covia will develop a plan and deliver software technology that leverages long-term evolution (LTE), existing communications systems, and Covia Labs' Connector interoperability platform to address these requirements. In future phases, this software can be used to build a working system that will operate over LTE on selected commercially available off-the-shelf, third-party communications equipment and land mobile radio systems to allow the seamless integration of mobile voice with text, photos, video messaging, Global Positioning System, maps and sensors across a wide range of devices.</text>
