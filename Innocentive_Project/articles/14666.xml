  <text>Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp., Systems Engineering Solutions, Boulder, Colorado, was awarded on May 11, 2015, a not-to-exceed $11,145,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for laser target interaction modeling and simulation. Contractor will conduct research leading to the development of advanced computational methods for predicting the physical phenomenology resulting from high energy laser interactions. Work will be performed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, and is expected to be complete by May 8, 2020. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with 10 offers received. Fiscal 2015 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $1,012,000 are being obligated at the time of award for task order 0001. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, is the contracting activity (FA9451-15-D-0046).</text>
