  <text>New technology using augmented reality blends digital data with the real world-blurring the line between computer-generated images and what we actually see. And the latest example of this concept is the Plane Finder AR app, which can instantly find the flight number, speed, altitude and more of an aircraft overhead. Pinkfroot Limited created Plane Finder AR for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, and the app utilizes the augmented reality capabilities of the smart phone to track flights overhead. When a user points the iPhone towards the sky, the app uses the built-in camera to pick up automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) feeds used by commercial planes. These feeds transmit the name, position and destination of the aircraft and even the distance between the plane and the user. Aircraft must be carrying ADS-B equipment to work with the app, but the developers say usage of the required technology is on the rise. The app is available in the iTunes App Store for $2.99.
