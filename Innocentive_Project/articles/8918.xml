  <text>This musical compilation offers buyers a chance to celebrate Christmas, help the military community and receive a reminder of all their blessings in one compact disc. The A Lil Heroes Christmas CD includes traditional songs wholly or partially sung by the children of troops killed in battle after 9/11. The discs cost $15 for one or $12/each for two or more, and 100 percent of the proceeds benefit Operation Ensuring Christmas. This charity provides financial, moral and rehabilitative support to help children recover from the grief and trauma caused by the ultimate sacrifice they can make for their country-the loss of a parent. Programs include providing Christmas gift cards in December and Christmas in July, through which the kids receive trips to theme parks in Orlando.

Information about ordering the CD, or how to purchase the music through iTunes or other digital means, is available on the website. The site also features a music video of the kids singing "Jingle Bells."

 Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
