  <text>Networking with individuals in your area just got easier with the free CanWeNetwork app for iOS and Android. The program uses geospatial technology and a powerful matching engine to recommend people nearby who you may want to connect with for professional networking and business opportunities.
	CanWeNetwork is built on top of the LinkedIn platform, and its recommendation engine uses multiple data sources to identify strong matches among users. Connections are based on location, skillset, experience, shared interests and personality traits.
	"The app uses the power of big data and mobile technology to see and capture actionable opportunities that without CanWeNetwork would simply pass you by unknown," explained James Sinclair, vice president of CanWe Studios, in a company press release.
	The app is now available in 10 languages in more than 100 countries.
	Download CanWeNetwork from the iTunes App Store or Google Play. You can also watch a video about how the app works.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
