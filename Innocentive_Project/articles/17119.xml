  <text>The Coast Guard's Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN) awarded a contract to FLIR Maritime U.S. Inc., of Nashua, New Hampshire, on Wednesday for the Scalable Integrated Navigation System, Two (SINS-2). The single award firm fixed price indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract is valued at $50 million and consists of a five-year base with a five-year option. The total period of performance is 10 years.?? SINS-2 is a suite of commercially available electronic equipment and sensors consisting of low-power radar/chart plotter, multifunction displays, single-frequency Global Positioning System and other required navigation components. This navigation system serves as the primary means of navigation on all Coast Guard small boats and as a backup navigation system on its cutters.

The contract will facilitate the installation of the system on more than 2,000 Coast Guard vessels consisting of 54 different classes over the life of the contract. SINS-2 uses a systems approach to provide seamless integration of critical navigation sensors and display capabilities to boat and cutter operators.? C3CEN is developing the engineering change for all affected cutter and small boat classes and anticipates initial prototyping in summer 2017.?
