  <text>Need a place to explore, document and share your outrageous inventions or creations? The Instructables app for iOS and Android has more than 100,000 tutorials, from useful do-it-yourself projects to recipes and new technologies. It is a home for creative minds around the globe.
	The idea for Instructables was born at the MIT Media Lab, where the future founders of the app's creator Squid Labs searched for a place to share their projects and connect with others. Instructables was officially spun out of Squid Labs in 2006 and has continued to grow exponentially.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play to get inspired.
