  <abstract>Help Hospitalized Veterans boosts the morale of sick or injured former troops by offering them a range of arts and crafts activities. </abstract>
  <text>For the past 40 years, Help Hospitalized Veterans (HHV) has been working to boost the morale of former service members in VA medical centers, military hospitals and state veterans homes. The organization provides arts and crafts supplies to patients, giving them an activity that engages the mind and fine motor skills. More than 300 kits are available, so veterans can select the ones suited to their personal needs. Since 1971, more than 27 million free kits have been handed out.

HHV also gives the public a chance to remind veterans that they are remembered and valued. Through the organization's correspondence program, citizens can send letters to veterans in medical care facilities. There is also an e-card option that allows site visitors to choose a card, personalize it and send it to a hospitalized or homebound veteran. For more information about other HHV efforts, how to participate in the programs or to donate funds to keep them going, visit the website.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
