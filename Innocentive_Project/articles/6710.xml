  <text>Electronic transactions may replace money entirely in a decade. That is the prediction of the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, Adm. James Stavridis, USN. Adm. Stavridis, also the commander of the U.S. European Command, told a luncheon audience at West 2010 that the changes being wrought by and through cyberspace are profound. "Paper money-kiss it goodbye," he declared. This prediction also is coming true right now: Afghanistan is skipping brick and mortar banks and going directly to electronic currency. The admiral described how the Afghan government now is paying its security forces electronically to their cell phones. This helps reduce corruption in that troubled nation.</text>
