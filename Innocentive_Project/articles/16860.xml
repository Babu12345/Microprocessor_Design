  <text>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) recently released the Virtuous User Environment (VirtUE) broad agency announcement. The goal of the VirtUE program is to create and demonstrate a more secure interactive user computing environment by leveraging the federal government’s impending migration to commercial cloud-based information technology infrastructures and the current explosion of new virtualization and operating system concepts. 

Proposals are due December 12.
Currently the government user computing environment is represented by a general purpose Windows desktop operating system running multiple installed applications hosted on either a dedicated physical computer or on a shared virtualized platform.

Collaborative efforts and teaming among potential performers are strongly encouraged, according to an IARPA statement. Program officials anticipate that teams will be multidisciplinary, including but not limited to expertise in areas such as virtualization, operating systems, user interfaces, machine learning, analytic development, cloud infrastructures and computer security.
