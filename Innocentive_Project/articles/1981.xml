  <text>Homefront Help is SIGNAL Connections’ effort to support U.S. service members, veterans and their families. The column highlights programs that offer resources and assistance to the military community ranging from care packages to benefits and everything in between. In that same spirit, Homefront Help presents opportunities for readers to donate time, offer resources and send words of thanks to those who sacrifice for freedom. Programs that provide services are listed in red. Opportunities for the public to reach out to service members are listed in blue. Each program description includes a link to the organization's Web site, when available.Military Family Support Centers IncorporatedMilitary families requiring just about any kind of help—from supplies to camaraderie—can find what they need here. Military Family Support Centers (MFSC) Incorporated, located in Salem, Virginia, is dedicated to identifying and meeting the needs of the families of deployed military members. The organization seeks to reduce the stress for troops and their families by providing ways for the community to express its gratitude through offering services, volunteering or making donations. MFSC offers an array of support including an information clearinghouse for military and civilian programs and benefits; telecommunications support such as videoconferencing, free long-distance and broadband Internet access; social interaction through support group organization assistance and a casual meeting place staffed by caring volunteers; home/car repair assistance offering reduced and no-cost repairs by qualified volunteers; a playroom for children to use while parents handle other issues; collaboration with local charities that provide food and clothing; transportation assistance; counseling; a limited amount of in-house baby supplies and canned goods; and TRICARE insurance assistance. The organization seeks volunteers to assist with its outreach efforts, and it solicits donations as well as sells items to raise money. More information and necessary forms are available on the Web site. Also available online is news about upcoming events, a newsletter, support links and contact information, including directions to the office. Anyone who needs assistance or knows of a military family who could benefit through MFSC’s help is encouraged to contact the organization by phone or e-mail or can drop by. The center has operating hours listed, but appointments can be made for other times as well.  Operation: Take a Soldier to the MoviesNo, this isn’t a way to get a date for Saturday night. Operation: Take a Soldier to the Movies sends “movie night” kits to troops in deployed locations. The project began as a way to support military members in war zones who had nothing to do outside of work hours. Each kit contains a letter of support from the donor with his or her mailing address included, a new or used DVD, artificially sweetened powdered drink mix packets (no tubs), movie theater-style candy (no chocolate) and microwavable popcorn. The public can assist the effort by passing the word about the project, contributing package items or making cash contributions. More information about donating is available on the Web site. Troops who would like to request a package can fill out the online form. Gold Star CouncilFamily members of those killed or missing in combat and the leaders of organizations that represent them met recently to form the Gold Star Council, which will unify the groups’ shared concerns on Gold Star and Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) issues. The participating groups will maintain their individual missions and identities while the Gold Star Council will represent the broader coalition on specific issues. Organizations involved with the new council include the American Gold Star Mothers, Gold Star Wives of America, National League of POW/MIA Families, Sons and Daughters in Touch, American World War II Orphans Network, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, the White House Commission on Remembrance, Snowball Express and Families United. The U.S. Navy Chaplain Corps also attended the meeting and will serve the Gold Star Council in an advisory capacity. Meeting organizer and Gold Star son Tony Cordero says the council can provide a comprehensive and cohesive voice to support the interests of those who survive fallen military heroes. Other Gold Star organizations and related veterans or military family groups interested in joining the Gold Star Council can contact Cordero at tony@sdit.org. E-mails should have the words "Gold Star Council" in the subject line. The SIGNAL Connectionsstaff encourages readers to take advantage of the programs mentioned in this column and to pass along the information. In addition, if you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please let us know about it. Submit that information to SIGNAL's news editor.Homefront Help Archives</text>
