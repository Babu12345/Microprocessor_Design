  <text>Raytheon Co., Largo, Fla., is being awarded a $30,020,420 cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost-only modification to previously awarded contract for design agent and engineering services in support of the Cooperative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) program. The CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
