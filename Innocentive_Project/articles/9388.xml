  <text>"I'll pay you back when I get some cash." Does that line sound familiar? You've likely found yourself in a situation where you need to pay someone but don't have cash or checks on hand. With the new Bump Pay app, making a quick payment is no longer a problem. Simply tap your iPhone against another phone to instantly send money.

Bump Technologies Incorporated developed the app and is the same innovative team behind the original Bump app, which allows users to transfer contact information by bumping phones together. In the latest offering, the same tapping motion allows anyone to send a payment to another person with a PayPal account.

Simply select the amount you want to send, bump phones and accept the transaction on the PayPal screen that comes up. The entire process is free.

Download the free app from the iTunes App Store. An Android version of the app is anticipated in the near future.
