  <text>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency announced today the award of the agency's largest cyber defense contract to date. The approximate 58 million Euro NATO Computer Incident Response Capability, Full Operational Capability contract was awarded to a Finmeccanica, Rome, Italy, and Northrop Grumman Corporation, Falls Church, Virginia. The contractor team will provide security on NATO's networks and protect over 22,000 NATO military and civilians employees enhancing NATO's cyber defense infrastructure and its ability to support member states. In addition to protecting its own networks, the contract will strengthen NATO's ability to support allies in case of cyber attacks, when requested, with improved information sharing and strengthened rapid reaction teams. The contractor will not only design, test, and install the cyber defense capabilities, but also provide the subsequent maintenance and support over a five year period. The project scope includes the implementation of a robust infrastructure of improved cyber defense sensors and management tools, cyber defence decision support capabilities and mobile kits for Cyber Rapid Reaction Teams.</text>
