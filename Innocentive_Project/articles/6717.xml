  <text>Finally have time to see some of the dynamic techs here at WEST 2010. Am at the Microsoft booth right now because I needed technical assistance to connect. What better place to go?!? So here we go with the incredible capabilities being demo'ed here. And of course, I'm going to start with Microsoft! At booth 1703, you'll find four major themes in newest techs: Microsoft virtualization leveraging Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 R2. It promotes high-availability server consolidation. And of course, since I'm running Windows 7, this has got to be the next one I talk about. Come to the booth to see the newest software and how it's different from what you've used before. The MS System Center helps organizations to manage the plethora of line of business workloads. Last but certainly not least, MS is demonstrating its Unified Communitions -- one of the greatest ways to communicate and collaborate.</text>
