  <text>Do you find yourself constantly scrambling for a sticky note or a scrap of paper to jot down reminders or ideas? Now, Android users can quickly capture what's on their minds with the free Google Keep app. It lets you write down ideas on the go, and you can even add a checklist, a voice memo or a photo.
	Notes created with the app are stored securely in the cloud and are accessible through Google Drive. Items created with Google Keep will sync to all your devices.
	Driving in the car or just too busy to type? Simply speak the note and the app will transcribe the voice memo. Color coding is available to help you find notes again later, and when you're finished, just archive it or delete it with a swipe of your finger.
	Google Keep is available on Google Play for devices running Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich and above.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
