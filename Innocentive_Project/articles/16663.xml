  <text>Adaptive space robotics, 3-D printing and autonomous communication systems are among the topics of 21 innovative research and development proposals selected by NASA to enable future solar system missions. The agencyâ€™s Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program chose proposals from 41 firms that can negotiate for possible contract awards worth a combined total of about $15.8 million.

The proposals, which are designed to have spinoff effects benefiting the U.S. economy, aim for advances in several areas. These include space weather prediction; gas-sensing technology for spacesuits; planetary compositional analysis and mapping; information systems for robotics; and advanced propulsion system ground test and launch. Some efforts combine innovations, such as new types of rocket fuel and exploitation of spacebound in situ resources.
