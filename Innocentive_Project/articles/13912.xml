  <text>Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., Bethpage, New York, is being awarded a $21,619,028 modification under previously awarded contract (N00024-06-C-6311) to provide two mission modules and support containers for mission packages that will deploy from and integrate with the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). The Navy’s plan is to use continuous evaluation of system maturity through a disciplined system engineering framework to improve mission capability in identified mission areas. LCS mission packages will be optimized for flexibility in the littorals. Mission package capabilities are currently focused on primary mission areas of mine warfare, emphasizing mine countermeasures, littoral anti-submarine warfare and littoral surface warfare operations, including prosecution of small boats. Work will be performed in Portsmouth, Virginia (44 percent); Huntsville, Alabama (31 percent); Bethpage, New York (22 percent); Hollywood, Maryland (2 percent); and Manchester, New Hampshire (1 percent) and is expected to be completed by July 2016. Fiscal 2014 other procurement (Navy) funding in the amount of $21,619,028 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.
