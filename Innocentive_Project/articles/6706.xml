  <text>One way of providing enhanced cybersecurity would be to establish high security zones into which users could operate amid greater security, suggested the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Gen James E. Cartright, USMC, speaking at West 2010, allowed that the military faces cybersecurity challenges in the greater realm of the Internet. "We have no authority in that Wild Wild West called .com, but we still operate there," he pointed out. He added that cybersecurity experts are working hard "to find a construct in which it is appropriate for the average American to go on the network and elect to have higher protection levels that allow us to protect them." These networks would be separated by creating demilitarized zones around them to allow higher security.</text>
