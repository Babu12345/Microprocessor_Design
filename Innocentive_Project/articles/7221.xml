  <text>The Boeing Company, St. Louis, Missouri, is being awarded an $8 million delivery order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement for non-recurring engineering associated with the integration of a synthetic radar Virtual Mission Training System (VMTS) into T-45C aircraft. Efforts to be provided include design, integration, test, validation and verification of two flight-worthy VMTS retrofit kits. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
