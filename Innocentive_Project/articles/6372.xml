  <text>The next SIGNAL Webinar will be held on September 24, 2009, at 12:00 PM Eastern.

Government agencies and departments around the globe are rapidly moving forward with their efforts of converging voice, data and video services onto a common IP infrastructure. The main force behind this accelerated transition to IP networks is a realization of the efficiency and cost savings from running multiple applications and services across a single infrastructure.

Sponsored by Juniper Networks, this seminar will focus on the capabilities and cost savings that might be possible with EoIP and the benefits of using one IP network for all applications, including voice, video and data traffic using circuit emulation as opposed to Voice over IP.
