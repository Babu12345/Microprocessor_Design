  <text>One more sign that the American military presence in Iraq is winding down: an Armed Forces Network(AFN) radio station is now off the air. After 8 years broadcasting in Baghdad, AFN-Iraq-better known as Freedom Radio-presented its final morning program on September 23 and now relays a satellite feed of AFN Europe. Guests on the final broadcast included Lt. Gen. Frank Helmick, USA, deputy commander, U.S. troops in Iraq, and Adrian Cronauer, the AFN radio broadcaster whose radio work was depicted in the 1987 movie Good Morning, Vietnam. The station closing comes 100 days before U.S. troops are expected to leave the Iraq, unless American military forces are asked to remain by the Iraqi government.</text>
