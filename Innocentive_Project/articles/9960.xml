  <text>ChemImage Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, recently announced that the U.S. Army Space &amp; Missile Defense Command awarded the company an $811,000 contract for integrating its real-time sensor technology used for standoff detection of explosives into a multi-sensor vehicle screening system.Â The comprehensive screening system is currently being designed to screen vehicles for explosives. ChemImage Corporation, in conjunction with other detection sensor developers, is working to design a system that will allow military personnel to detect vehicle-borne threats from a safe distance.</text>
