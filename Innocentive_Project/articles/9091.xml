  <abstract>Camaraderie breeds heroism among those who put service to others first, says one who has received the nation's highest military honor.</abstract>
  <text>Sgt. 1st Class Leroy Petry, USA, who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism in Afghanistan, said that he looks at his fellow soldiers as family-"and I would do anything to protect my family," he told the audience in an emotionally packed luncheon at West 2012 today, where he was interviewed by former Good Morning America host David Hartman. Sgt. 1st Class Petry received the Medal of Honor after saving other members of his Army Ranger unit by picking up and hurling a grenade that landed near them. The grenade exploded, and the blast cost him his right hand and part of his forearm. He now wears a plaque on his prosthesis that lists the names of the members of his Ranger battalion who have given their lives in the Global War on Terrorism. This love for fellow soldiers is what drives an individual soldier to risk everything for others, he told the audience. As service members, they are his family. The sergeant first class has re-enlisted to make the Army his career. Because of his lost limb, he has not been allowed to return to the front-although he has tried, he admitted. He says his passion now is trying to help those who are coming back from the fight.</text>
