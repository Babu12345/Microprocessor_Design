  <text>Goodrich Corp., Engineered Polymer Products (EPP) division, Jacksonville, Florida, is being awarded a $14,485,802 indefinite-delivery/indefinite quantity, firm-fixed-price contract for high-frequency array (HFA) windows for four classes of United States submarines (SSGN class; Seawolf class; USS Virginia class; and second flight USS Los Angeles class). The HFA is an acoustic "window" used in conjunction with the high frequency sail array. The primary purpose of an HFA window is to provide an acoustically transparent interface to seawater from the HFA by allowing high frequency acoustic signals to pass through with little reflection or attenuation. Secondly, the window provides protection to the array from afloat debris and provides smoother conformance to the hull, thereby reducing flow noise. Work will be performed in Jacksonville, Florida, and is expected to be completed by January 2020. Fiscal 2012 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding in the amount of $426,228 will be obligated at time of award, and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with one offer received. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Newport, Rhode Island, is the contracting activity (N66604-15-D-0449).</text>
