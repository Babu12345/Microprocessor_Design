  <text>L-3 Communications announced today that it has been awarded an $81.8 million contract from Raytheon Australia to supply the Australian Defence Force (ADF) with 236 Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs), additional support equipment and training as part of Joint Project 2008 Phase 5B1. This program will further enable the ADF to utilize the Wideband Global Satellite Communications system, significantly increasing its satellite communications capabilities. Two L-3 business units, Global Communications Solutions (GCS) and Linkabit, will perform on this contract, with hardware deliveries expected to be completed this year. The contract will deliver L-3 GCS’s Hawkeye and Panther family of VSAT terminals, integrated with L-3 Linkabit’s MPM family of modems, and includes the option to purchase additional terminals and equipment. These terminals will enable ADF troops on the ground to benefit from increased data rates and a higher level of network performance. This award comes as a follow-on to the $35 million Joint Project 2008 Phase 3H contract awarded to L-3 in 2013 for 54 Hawkeye III Lite VSATs and support equipment.</text>
