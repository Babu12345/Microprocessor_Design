  <text>General Dynamics Information Technology, Fairfax, Virginia, has been awarded three task orders to provide information technology (IT) services under the Federal Bureau of Investigation Information Technology Supplies and Support Services (FBI IT Triple S) contract. The task orders have a combined value of $19 million over eight years. General Dynamics was awarded the FBI IT Triple S contract in October 2010. Under the first task order, General Dynamics will deliver a full range of information assurance and security support to assist the FBI Digital Evidence Section. Specifically, the company will perform systems engineering, administration and security duties, as well as training development and office management. The company will also work with FBI intelligence analysts to develop and update certification and accreditation processes and programs for both new and legacy IT systems. Under a second task order, General Dynamics will operate and maintain the FBI's Enterprise Management System (EMS). In addition, the company will manage workflow and implement and maintain patch, software and image-management tools to enable users to access and share data securely. Under a third task order, General Dynamics will engineer, configure, integrate, troubleshoot and advise on the procurement of virtual server platforms and thin client configurations in enterprise-wide FBI environments.</text>
