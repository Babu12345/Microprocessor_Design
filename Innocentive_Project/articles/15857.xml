  <text>The Boeing Co., Seattle, Washington, is being awarded a $9,335,027 modification to a previously awarded cost-plus-fixed-fee contract (N00019-04-C-3146) for engineering services and supplies to update the flight simulators in support of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft. This modification includes the second configuration of the P-8A simulators with air-to-air refueling and flight test efforts. Work will be performed in Seattle, Washington (70 percent); and Patuxent River, Maryland (30 percent), and is expected to be completed in January 2018. Fiscal 2016 research, development, testing and evaluation (Navy) funds in the amount of $150,000 are being obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
