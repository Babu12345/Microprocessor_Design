  <text>Math is not my strong suit; I always travel with a calculator and a tip card to help me scoot by. I know I'm not alone thanks to CheckPlease. With this app, math-challenged diners can easily split a tab among multiple people and figure out the tip in just a few seconds. The app even calculates the tip on the total before tax. There are two versions of CheckPlease: a free one that features ads or an ad-free version that costs $0.99. It's available for download to iPhones and iPod Touch here. What's your favorite app?
