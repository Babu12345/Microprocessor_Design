  <abstract>A niche vehicle may provide the best of both worlds.</abstract>
  <text>A class of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be able to provide vital communications, surveillance and reconnaissance for warfighters. These UAVs fall into a niche between large, long-endurance craft and personal UAVs that are launched by hand. The small UAVs would incorporate many of the best features of the other two classes. David E. Anderson of Insitu Inc. described to a Tuesday MILCOM 2010 panel audience how these UAVs would fill important roles in theater. They would give a battlefield commander-primarily in a division or a battalion-an organic capability for providing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance with a small logistical footprint. The UAV would offer electro-optic/infrared mid-wave sensing to provide a degree of persistent surveillance. One version Anderson cited would be able to carry a 25-pound payload for 15 hours over a battlefield. In addition to optical sensing, it could carry a payload for detecting improvised explosive devices or chemical/biological agents. The small UAV also could serve in roles such as mapping and close air support, Anderson suggested. Its ability to serve in a hub-and-spoke configuration could extend its data reach.</text>
