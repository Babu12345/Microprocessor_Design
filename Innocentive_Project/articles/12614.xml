  <text>Many people dream of moving somewhere new and finding the perfect community. If you had the chance, where would you go? The dwellr app from the U.S. Census Bureau takes out the guesswork by recommending the top 25 U.S. cities and towns that best fit your lifestyle.
	City or country? Beach or mountains? The app uses your preferences and statistics powered by the American Community Survey to search every neighborhood in the nation and find the best matches. It evaluates more than 40 topics, from home values to education, total population, marital status, dream jobs, families with children and how people commute to work.
	Curious about the neighborhood where you live now? The app uses GPS to provide details on your current location.
	According to the Census Bureau, the app is part of the bureau's plan to follow the Digital Government Strategy and make its statistics more available anytime, anywhere.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
