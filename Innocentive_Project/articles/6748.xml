The excellent Armed With Science blog has a great post that provides step-by-step instructions on how to submit your ideas. Be sure to check it out and then head over to the Defense Department's Open Gov page to get started. The Defense Department's plan will be published in April, so submit your suggestions by March 17.</text>
