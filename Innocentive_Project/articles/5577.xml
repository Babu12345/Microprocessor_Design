  <text>AAI Corporation has been awarded a 12-month contract valued at approximately $3 million by the U.S. Army's Project Manager Soldier Weapons organization for 50 Projectile Detection and Cueing (PDCue) gunshot detection systems. PDCue will be integrated on an up-armored M1151 vehicle with the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station, or CROWS II. The PDCue four-corner system incorporates modular design and open architecture to ensure seamless plug-and-play integration of the system with weapon stations such as CROWS II. The integrated systems are expected to be fielded with the Army overseas for operational evaluation.</text>
