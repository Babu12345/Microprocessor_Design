  <text>UES Inc., Dayton, Ohio, has been awarded a $46,200,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the Molecular Signatures program to develop technologies to discover, characterize, detect, and analyze complex biosignatures in order to provide tools for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and human performance assessment. Multiple sensing modalities will be used to qualitatively and quantitatively measure molecular signatures for increased situational awareness of the operational environment and performance of the human (operator and analyst) in that environment. The program is charged with leading identification and characterization of the molecular attributes present in humans, the environment and pathogen biology for the purposes of developing human-centric ISR solutions. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-14-D-6516).</text>
