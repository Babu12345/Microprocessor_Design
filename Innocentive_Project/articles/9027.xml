  <abstract>Send your manufacturers' coupons-even expired ones-to the Troopons program, and they'll go to military families who can use them. </abstract>
  <text>Military families are enjoying a little extra financial support thanks to Troopons, a joint venture between Support Our Troops and CouponCabin. The program asks people to send in manufacturers' coupons (and only manufacturers' coupons) from any source except the Internet, and the deals will be sent to those who need them. Troopons even accepts expired coupons, which can be used on military bases for up to six months past their expiration dates.

The effort supports military families at domestic and foreign installations. Troops stationed at the latter especially can benefit because they often don't have access to the coupons and weak exchange rates mean dollars don't go as far. The most helpful coupons offer discounts on food items with baby supplies ranking as the second priority. Common household goods coupons help, too.

To participate, mail your coupons to the addresses below:

Active Coupons:
CouponCabin.com
attn: Active Troopons
P.O. Box 231
Whiting, IN 46394-0231

or

Expired Coupons:
(Less than 3 months remaining or expiration dates within the last 90 days)
CouponCabin.com
Attn: Expired Troopons
P.O. Box 430
Whiting, IN 46394-0430

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their familiesÂ please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
