  <abstract>I am obsessed with the Internet Movie Database, also known as IMDb. I probably visit the site at least once a day. My favorite thing to do is look up quotes from and trivia about my favorite movies and TV shows, like The Office.

  <text>I am obsessed with the Internet Movie Database, also known as IMDb. I probably visit the site at least once a day. My favorite thing to do is look up quotes from and trivia about my favorite movies and TV shows, like The Office. (Did you know that the computers on the set are hooked up to the Internet, and cast members check e-mail when they're in the background of a shot?) With the free IMDb app for iPhones and iPod Touch, fans like me can get their trivia fix any time. The application provides access to more than 1.5 million movies and TV shows, more than 3.2 million celebrity listings, U.S. movie showtimes and TV listings, trailers and more. The app is available for download on iTunes. I encourage you to proceed with caution though. You may get addicted. Like this post?
