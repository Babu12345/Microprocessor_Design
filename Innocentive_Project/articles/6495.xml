  <text>Apps for your printer? Yup. HP has an Internet-connected printer-the HP Photosmart Premium TouchSmart Web All-in-One printer-that comes with pre-loaded apps that have something for everyone. The Google Maps app lets users enter their destination and print out a map. Families can stay on track by printing out everyone's weekly schedules with Google Calendar. Through the DreamWorks Animation app, movie fans can view upcoming movie trailers without logging on to the computer. Apps from Coupons.com, USATODAY.com, Nickelodeon, Fandago and more are also available. HP says that people will be able to create their own apps later this year.
