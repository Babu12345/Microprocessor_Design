  <text>A new Android app from the U.S. Defense Department provides enjoyable activity suggestions to help service members returning from combat deployments improve their moods and overcome depression. Positive Activity Jackpot, developed by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology, taps into a type of behavioral therapy called "pleasant event scheduling." The app uses augmented reality and a smartphone's GPS to locate nearby pleasant activities and diversions. Making these daily plans can help a service member adjust to life at home after returning from a deployment with a structured daily schedule. By using the app, service members can pick activities and friends to accompany them, and they can even pull a lever from the app "slot machine" to spin for a random idea. Download the free app from Google Play.  This app should not be used as a substitute for professional treatment.
