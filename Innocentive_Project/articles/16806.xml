  <text>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh C. Johnson gave a report on the department’s progress in cyber hiring, announcing more than 120 new employees.

The announcement comes during National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. “Cybersecurity has been one of our department’s most important missions, and hiring top cyber talent is crucial to our success in that mission,” he said in the statement.

In July, DHS held its first-ever Cyber and Technology Job Fair. The two-day event generated more than 14,000 applicants, 2,500 walk-in candidates and 842 onsite interviews. As a result, the DHS made more than 400 prospective job offers. Of this number, more than 120 candidates became new employees within 60 days.

“We thank Congress for new legal authorities in support of our cyber recruitment and retention efforts. The department is maximizing its use of these authorities to build our cyber work force,” said Johnson. “We also thank the Office of Personnel Management for granting DHS the authority to hire 1,000 cyber professionals this calendar year.”</text>
