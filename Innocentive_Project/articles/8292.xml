  <text>Ditch your video and digital cameras in favor of the free Mobli app for iPhone. The program allows you to instantly upload images and movies to specific channels to share them with friends and family. 

Developed by Mobli Media Incorporated, the app helps you upload pictures and videos from your iPhone within seconds. Similar to Twitter, you create an account that friends and other users can "follow." Your account can be kept open to the public or private for select groups.

Once you upload a picture or video to your account, you can attach it to a channel or group. Current channels cover a variety of topics, including food, music, cars, news, sports and celebrity spotting. If you miss your favorite band in concert or your favorite sports team on the field, simply find the associated channel and follow along live as pictures and videos pop up.

In addition, you can create your own channel or group for events. Set up a shared album for a wedding or party and allow guests to instantly upload photos to the same place. The app can also link to other accounts, including Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare.

Download Mobli from the iTunes App Store. It should be available for BlackBerry and Android in the coming weeks.
