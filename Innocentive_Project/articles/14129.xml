  <text>The U.S. Navy is exploiting its own assets and other capabilities to defend and protect against cyberthreats. Some of these internal assets include automated triggers in networks as well as advanced intelligence sources.

Vice Adm. Jan Tighe, USN, commander, Fleet Cyber Command and commander, Tenth Fleet, described some of these measures to the Thursday morning audience at West 2015, being held in San Diego, February 10-12. These efforts are built around her vision, which is to conduct operations through cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum to guarantee Navy operations while denying the same to adversaries.

Adm. Tighe said the Navy leverages all-source intelligence to identify emerging threats. Her command layers sensors, analysts and hunters inside the network. Automatic intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance is used to trigger responses in the network, or the network is maneuvered out of harmâ€™s way when a threat is seen coming.

The Navy is providing 40 teams as part of the U.S. Cyber Command, and the admiral describes these as her expeditionary units. While Navy cyber work continues to expand, she warned that, if sequestration continues to loom, the Navy will have an increasingly difficult time confronting the threat in cyberspace.</text>
