  <text>American Science and Engineering Incorporated (AS&amp;E), Billerica, Massachusetts, recently announced the receipt of an order for two ZBV(R) mobile screening systems from a new international customer, the Kingdom of Lesotho. The ZBV systems will screen vehicles and cargo for threats and trade fraud on its border with South Africa to facilitate trade and counter smuggling. The Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA) has launched a Customs Modernization Program aimed at simplifying border procedures while speeding up the inspection process.</text>
