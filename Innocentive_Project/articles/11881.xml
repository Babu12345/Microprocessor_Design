  <text>L3-Kollmorgen Corp., Northampton, Mass., was awarded a $10,970,754 modification to previously awarded contract (N00024-11-C-5447), for the fiscal 2013 MK 20 Electro-Optical Sensor System units including the associated equipment, services and emergent provisioned item order for spares requirements and level-of-effort engineering services. The MK 20 Electro-Optical Sensor System is employed as a check sight and targeting sensor for anti-surface and anti-air warfare, and naval gun fire support missions as well as ship self defense and situational awareness. This contract combines purchases for the U.S. Navy (74 percent) and the government of Australia (26 percent) under the foreign military sales Program. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity. </text>
