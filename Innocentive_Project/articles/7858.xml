  <text>APIC Corporation, Culver City, California, recently announced that it has received a U.S. Naval Air Systems Command Â Small Business Innovation Research Phase I contract to design an integrated optical code division multiple access (CDMA) network system that addresses multi-level security at speeds beyond what is possible with electronics. CDMA provides efficiency, security, and multi-access benefits in wireless communications. APIC's system takes the basic ideas of CDMA and implements it in fiber optic network.</text>
