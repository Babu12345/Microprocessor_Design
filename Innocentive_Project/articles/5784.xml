  <text>Raytheon Company is being awarded a $15 million modification to a previously awarded contract to provide an increase in option exercise for engineering and technical services in support of the MK15 Phalanx Close-In-Weapon System (CIWS). The Phalanx CIWS is a fast-reaction terminal defense against low- and high-flying, high-speed maneuvering anti-ship missile threats that have penetrated all other ships' defenses. </text>
