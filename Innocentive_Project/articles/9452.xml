  <text>The TAPS tragedy assistance organization is seeking current military members or recent veterans to serve as mentors for children and teens attending the Good Grief Camp. During the event, young persons who have lost a parent, stepparent or sibling in combat will gather to form peer support networks and to learn to cope with their heartache. They also will discover how America honors its warfighters and take breaks from the grief focus to have some fun. The camp will be held Friday to Sunday over Memorial Day weekend (May 25 to 27) in Arlington, Virginia, with an optional Monday activity.

Mentors must be available for all of the required three days and to attend a mandatory training session. More information including how to volunteer is available on the website. Caregivers who would like to register someone 19 or younger to attend the camp have until May 7 or until 450 children have signed up.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
