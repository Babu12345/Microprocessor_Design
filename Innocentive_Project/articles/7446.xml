  <text>Raytheon Company recently received a $21 million contract for the Triple Target Terminator (T3) program, which will develop a high-speed, long-range missile that can engage air, cruise missile, and air defense targets. T3 would be carried internally on stealth aircraft or externally on fighters, bombers and unmanned aircraft. T3 would allow any aircraft to rapidly switch between air-to-air and air-to-surface capabilities. T3's speed, maneuverability, and network-centric capabilities would significantly improve U.S. aircraft survivability and increase the number and variety of targets that could be destroyed on each sortie. The enabling technologies are: propulsion, multi-mode seekers, data links, digital guidance and control and advanced warheads. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
