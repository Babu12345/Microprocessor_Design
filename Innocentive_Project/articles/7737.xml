  <text>The United Services Automobile Association (USAA), dedicated to facilitating the financial security of military families, now offers a wide range of mobile services. USAA Mobile, a free app for iPhone and Android, gives USAA members access to branchless banking. With the click of a button, users can pay bills, transfer funds, trade stocks, deposit checks, calculate loans, locate rental cars and get insurance cards. To deposit a check, you simply open Deposit Mobile within the app, enter the deposit amount, choose your account, take photos of your endorsed check and get confirmation of your deposit. On the latest version of the app, users also can find local USAA financial centers; locate a real estate agent; get a cash bonus with Movers Advantage; and connect with USAA on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. USAA Mobile is compatible with iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Android. For additional app requirements, check the USAA website. Visit the iTunes App Store or the Android Market to download.
