  <text>The U.S. Defense Department has signed a space situational awareness (SSA) memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Australiaâ€™s Department of Defence. The MOU permits the the two countries to exchange SSA data, which facilitates transparency and improve flight safety.
	Advanced data exchanges support launches, maneuver planning, on-orbit anomaly resolution, electromagnetic interference reporting and investigation. In addition, sharing this information assists in identifying launch anomalies and decommissioning activities as well as supports on-orbit conjunction assessments.</text>
