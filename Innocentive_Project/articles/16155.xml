  <abstract>The U.S. Navy wants to apply lessons learned by industry in the commercial marketplace to its own information technology capabilities. So, it is instituting Technology Exchange Meetings, or TEMs, in which industry can present solutions based on its own experiences with new capabilities.</abstract>
  <text>The U.S. Navy’s Next-Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) is establishing a formal feedback procedure to seek best practice solutions from industry. Known as Technology Exchange Meetings (TEMs), this new approach will focus on lessons learned that could be applied to military systems.

Speaking at the NGEN Re-Compete Industry Day II in Tysons, Virginia, Andrew Tash, chief engineer for Naval Enterprise Networks, explained the TEM philosophy represents a continued dialogue with industry. Emphasizing that the Navy does not want “a sales pitch,” Tash said industry would submit white papers describing how it solved a particular challenge in the private sector and how the solution could be applied to the Navy’s network needs. 

The TEMs would not be implemented before the Navy decides on its new NGEN approach. Instead, they would be a part of the new contract vehicle that replaces the existing version in June 2018. Tash also declared that no product or acquisition decisions would be made on the basis of TEM white papers. “We need your feedback,” he said to a roomful of industry representatives.</text>
