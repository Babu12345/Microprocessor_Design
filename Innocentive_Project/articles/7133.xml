  <text>ViaSat, Inc., Carlsbad, California, was recently awarded a $37.6 million firm-fixed-price contract to provide blue force tracking 2 (BFT-2) for Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2). Â BFT-2 is the next generation of the BFT transceiver/network. With BFT-2, FBCB2 will have the capability to upgrade position reports in seconds rather than minutes, thousands of platforms will share a single satellites channel, resulting in reduced recurring cost, and icons on a computer screen will more accurately represent a vehicle's location. U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Command Acquisition Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
