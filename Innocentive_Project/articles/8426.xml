  <text>The U.S. Air Force has awarded Rockwell Collins, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a contract to provide systems integration and avionics for the KC-10 Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Cockpit Modernization Program. The contract, valued at more than $160 million over the life of the program, calls for Rockwell Collins to provide the flight management system, displays, data link communications and surveillance capabilities. The KC-10 aircraft is an Air Mobility Command advanced tanker and cargo aircraft designed to provide increased global mobility for U.S. armed forces. Although the aircraft's primary mission is aerial refueling, it can combine the tasks of a tanker and cargo aircraft by refueling fighters and simultaneously carrying fighter support personnel and equipment on overseas deployments.</text>
