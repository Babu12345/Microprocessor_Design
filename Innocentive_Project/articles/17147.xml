  <text>The U.S. Army awarded a $39,000,000 firm fixed price time and material contract to Systematic, Centreville, Virginia, for a command and control and battle-management system that will serve as the common framework to synch mission command functions and data, providing increased collaboration and flexibility.

Systematic's SitaWare will provide scalable and seamless information sharing across systems and devices, taking a significant step toward the Army's continued evolution of its Command Post Computing Environment. As a scalable command, control, communications, computers and intelligence system, SitaWare supports infrastructure services to deliver digital information across handheld, mounted and command post mission command systems. Acting as a digital mediation service between the devices, it enables the processing and delivery of mission command data to commanders regardless of the device.</text>
