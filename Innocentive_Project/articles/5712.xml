  <text>Troops might not always feel lifted by the wings of angels, but Air Compassion for Veterans is making sure they come close. The organization provides free travel services for eligible warfighters, wounded warriors, veterans and their families to ensure none of them is denied access to distant medical care because of a lack of means to acquire long-distance medical air transportation. Air Compassion for Veterans arranges and provides its charitable patient travel without duplicating the efforts of other charities. The Web site includes a link that lists other groups who offer similar services and may be able to assist with certain needs. People interested in seeking assistance from Air Compassion for Veterans can access the help online or call (888) 662-6794. Also posted online is information about donating to the organization. The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
