  <text>Azimuth Corp., Dayton, Ohio, has been awarded a $23,734,700 cost-reimbursable, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity modification (P00006) to an existing contract (FA8650-09-D-5434) to advance research and development efforts for the Hardened Materials Research and Survivability Studies Program. General Dynamics Information Technology Inc., Dayton, Ohio, has been awarded a $23,734,700 cost-reimbursable, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity modification (P00006) to an existing contract (FA8650-09-D-5430). The modifications are to transition and advance the state-of-the-art in materials technologies, hardening concepts, and survivability applications associated with the protection and sustainability of Air Force aircrews and systems from a host of threats associated with photonic light and electromagnetic energy sources. Key technical areas in the program include optical materials and processing, hardening materials and processing, electro-optic/infrared sensor protection, warfighter protection, structural protection, optical technology, computational and theoretical studies on functional materials, proactive threat defeat, and high-energy laser source materials. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity. </text>
