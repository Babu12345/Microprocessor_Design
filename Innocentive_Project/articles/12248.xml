  <text>Goodrich Corp., Westford, Mass., has been awarded a $183 million firm-fixed-price undefinitized contract action (P00013) for an existing contract (FA8620-12-C-4020) for the Royal Saudi Air Force DB110 Reconnaissance System program. This modification changes the requirements to include in-country setup and installation, ground stations, and pod survey study being produced under the basic contract. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.
