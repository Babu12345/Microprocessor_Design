  <text>Data Link Solutions LLC, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is being awarded a $124,326,550 modification under a previously awarded multiple award contract (N00039-10-D-0031) increasing the scope authorized to perform all of the necessary design and development work required to bring Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) capability to the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) terminal and to achieve a successful critical design review. ViaSat Inc., Carlsbad, California, is being awarded a $72,673,450 modification under a previously awarded multiple award contract (N00039-10-D-0032). MIDS JTRS is a pre-planned product improvement replacement that transforms the MIDS low volume terminal into a four-channel, software-communications architecture-compliant JTRS terminal, while maintaining current Link-16 and tactical air navigation capability. TTNT will significantly increase operational Link-16 networks' capacities, improve network performance, and provide more capable and flexible Link-16 network designs for the warfighter. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, is the contracting activity.</text>
