  <text>SRA International Incorporated has been awarded a contract by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to support the Cyber Security Management Center (CSMC). The contract has a potential value of more than $56 million if all options are exercised. SRA will support the CSMC to defend and protect the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the FAA and other federal agencies from cyber attacks. The CSMC is established as the DOT's focal point for all information security incidents and provides a centralized operation that monitors and tracks information security incidents; conducts sensor data analysis; establishes trend analysis documentation; provides proactive and responsive corrective action capability; and provides the DOT with innovative, proactive cyber-attack prevention, detection and response capability.</text>
