3 Phoenix Inc., Chantilly, Va., is being awarded a potential $75 million cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for engineering services to support software development, procurement of commercial off-the-shelf products, and hardware/software integration required to provide improved technology for U.S. Navy open architecture and network-centric operations and warfare systems in support of Virginia-class submarines and other submarine and surface ship systems. This effort is for a follow-on Phase III of a Small Business Innovative Research, topic number N04-138—Real-time Data Fusion and Visualization Interface for Environmental Research Data. These services will be rendered as needed to support the Navy's initiative to maintain the pace of performance improvement through judicious use of lower power electronics, advanced algorithm design, and innovative applications of open software and hardware. The Naval Sea Systems command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.
