  <text>The Employer Partnership (EP) of the Armed Forces exists to link U.S. employers with service members, veterans and their families. Through the initiative, the military community can receive help leveraging its military training and experience for civilian career opportunities with national, regional and local employer partners. The organization has program support managers in 25 locations who serve as liaisons with human resources departments at companies and agencies on behalf of the military. The managers also post information about job fairs and other events as well as work with service members to refine their applications, resume writing and interview skills. Career counselors work to help members of the military community achieve career goals.

Through the EP, troops can gain advantages over other job hunters because the program's employer partners understand military training and may have necessary credentialing and licensing to enable veterans to begin work right away. Employers who participate benefit by accessing a free link to those in the military community looking for civilian jobs. To access all of the EP resources, users must create an account.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
