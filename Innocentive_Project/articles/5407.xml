  <text>The Defense Technical Information Center and the Director of Defense Research and Engineering have launched a U.S. Defense Department science and technology wiki. DoDTechipedia, an online encyclopedia, aims at promoting transparency and communication among the department's scientists, engineers, program managers and warfighters. In addition, the department believes it will enhance its ability to collaborate across the enterprise, identify solutions for technology challenges and ensure the efficient use of resources. Operated as a live forum, DoDTechipedia allows users to see and discuss innovative technologies throughout the Defense Department and emerging technology from the academic and private sectors.</text>
