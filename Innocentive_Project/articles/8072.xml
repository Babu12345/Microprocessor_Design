  <text>Kollmorgen Corporation, Electro-Optical Division, Northampton, Massachussetts, is being awarded a $16 million contract modification to exercise cost-type options for the materials and travel associated with engineering services for the photonics mast program. The photonics mast is a non-hull penetrating electronic imaging subsystem of the command and control system. The photonics mast incorporates visible, infrared and electronic support measures sensors and stealth features that will provide new capabilities for attack submarines. The subsystem comprises the sensor group, the mast group, the data transmission group, and the control and display group. The AN/BVS-1 photonics mast system will be installed on the Virginia-class submarines. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
