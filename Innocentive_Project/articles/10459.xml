Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, Portsmouth, R.I., is being awarded a $7,900,098 modification under previously awarded contract to conduct a critical design review for Airborne Mine Neutralization System near surface capability. The Airborne Mine Neutralization System mission is designed to re-acquire, identify, and destroy volume, close tethered and bottom mines which have been previously detected, classified and localized by other means while operating from Littoral Combat Ship-based MH-60S helicopters. The Navy’s plan is to design solutions to extend performance to provide a capability against surface and near-surface moored mines. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
