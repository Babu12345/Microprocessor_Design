  <text>The SCVNGR app for iPhone and Android challenges users to go to new places and earn points, and its growing client list includes the U.S. Navy. SCVNGER is a game with a simple objective: go places, do challenges, earn points. Players unlock badges and rewards and share what they're doing with friends. The app allows users to check-in to locations, snap pictures, scan QR codes and complete activities. In addition, players can earn points by bumping phones with their friends. The app is free and can be easily played at your own pace. Rewards include free food, like ice cream and pizza, and discounted items and services. Players unlock rewards by traveling to new places listed within the app and completing challenges. Business can add rewards to their locations to attract users.
