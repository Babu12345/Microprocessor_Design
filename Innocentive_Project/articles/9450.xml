  <text>The U.S. Defense Department has revamped its Telework Program for the civilian work force. Leaders at each Defense Department component now are required to promote telework within their organizations and to take all possible steps to overcome artificial barriers to program implementation. In addition, they must authorize telework for the maximum number of positions without compromising mission readiness and integrate telework into continuity-of-operations activities. These alterations to the former telework policy evolved out of the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010. Officials expect the changes will help the military achieve greater flexibility in its management of the work force, given their belief that telework improves recruiting, retention and quality of work life and is an integral readiness strategy for continuity of operations during an emergency.</text>
