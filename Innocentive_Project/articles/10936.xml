  <text>The America's Army comics from the U.S. Army, designed to highlight the reality of being a soldier, are now available for the iPad and Android tablets. The free app features the first two issues of the comics, which follow the saga of courageous U.S. soldiers deployed to the fictional war torn region of Czervenia.
	Readers can enjoy the story through animated panels, authentic sound effects and musical scores.
	The app was developed by the same team that created the successful America's Army PC gameâ€”the Software Engineering Directorate of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command's Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center. While the America's Army game is more than a decade old, the app is a relatively new offering and will continue to be updated with new issues and features.
	"Comic books and the Army have been around for a long time," Marsha Berry, Army Game Studio public game director, explains. Both the game and the comic include the latest Army technology and emphasize that there is more to being a soldier than just guns.
	Download the app from the iTunes App Store or Googly Play.
