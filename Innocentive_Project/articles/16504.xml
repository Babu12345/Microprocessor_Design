  <text>Leidos, Sterling, Virginia, is being awarded a $49,495,500 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract incorporating firm-fixed-price contract line-item numbers for the supply of hardware equipment and logistic support for the ship control system, navigation critical distribution system, ship control display system, automated bridge system and various human-machine-interface display applications for five years. Work will be performed in Sterling, Virginia, and is expected to be completed by December 2016. Fiscal 2016 working capital funds; fiscal 2016 operations and maintenance (Navy); and fiscal 2016 research, develop, test and evaluation (Navy) funding in the amount of $116,008 will be obligated at the time of award. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured in accordance with 10 U.S Code 2304(c)(1)—only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia Division, Philadelphia, is the contracting activity (N64498-16-D-0005).
