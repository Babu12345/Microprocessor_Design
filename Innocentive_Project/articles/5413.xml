  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation has been awarded a contract to develop single-frequency fiber amplifiers for the new Revolution in Fiber Lasers program by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Northrop Grumman will design the building blocks needed to combine laser beams that can be scaled to a weapons-class power level while maintaining good beam quality. Northrop Grumman received a $4.5 million, 15-month contract for Phase I, with an option for a $4.6 million, 18-month Phase II contract.</text>
