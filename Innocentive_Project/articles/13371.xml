  <text>Accenture Federal Services LLC, Arlington, Virginia, is being awarded a $6,737,530 firm-fixed-price contract for the development, testing, and implementation of the Electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) system solution. The eTWD solution will replace the current paper-driven instructions and processes at the naval shipyards by using technology to integrate work instructions, drawings, data tables, verification signatures, problem resolution and work control forms into an online certifiable technical work document. This contract includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $16,301,595. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington District of Columbia, is the contracting activity (N00024-14-C-4319).</text>
