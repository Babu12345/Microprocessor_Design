  <abstract>Smaller and faster with proper support are the means for delivering new systems that will support the fleet for long-term uses.</abstract>
  <text>The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps know the technology capabilities that they need from industry, but they want the solutions to suit warfighter needs-not requirements. A West 2012 panel focusing on the needs of the warfighter told industry attendees that some old approaches no longer will work. "It's all about reliability," said Brig. Gen. Gregg A. Sturdevant, USMC, assistant wing commander, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. "Keep it simple and reliable for maintainability." Rear Adm. Jerry K. Burroughs, USN, program executive officer for C4I, outlined a technology wish list that includes changes in traditional approaches. The government will want full data rights for whatever industry is developing, he stated, adding, "The days of government not getting proprietary data rights are over." Wish list items listed by Adm. Burroughs include improved two way communications with steerable antenna beams and multibeam antennas; network management technologies for operating in degraded environments; and robust, modular, scalable computer capabilities. Foremost is information assurance, which the admiral described as having an exploding number of requirements to keep networks secure. "If we don't get our arms around that, we will never be able to afford to keep our networks secure," he warned.</text>
