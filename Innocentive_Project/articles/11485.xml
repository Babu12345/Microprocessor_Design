Science Applications International Corp., McLean, Va., has been awarded a not-to-exceed $30 million modification (P00038) to an undefinitized contractual action (FA8650-10-C-1887) for operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) of Angel Fire Spiral 2+ Blue Devil Block I. Work will be performed in Afghanistan. The total cumulative face value of the contract is $243,484,412. The contract modification is for the Blue Devil Block 1 outside the continental United States O&amp;M program, which will provide operational mission support of deployed warfighters with an advanced multi-intelligence, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensor system. This additional work reflects the extension of the program up to six months. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.  </text>
