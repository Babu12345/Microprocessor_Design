  <text>The IntoNow app for iPhone can instantly identify any TV show. Just tap a button when a show is playing, and the program will identify the show and episode; provide all the data and links associated with it; and help you share what you're watching on Twitter and Facebook.

It will also show what your friends are watching and which shows are popular at a particular point in time. Use the app to identify any TV show from the last five years; see information on future airings; receive notifications when your friends are watching the same episode or show; and comment on what others are viewing.

The app uses a new technology called SoundPrint, which reads the sound waves and patterns of each television show and matches it with a database. It can then identify what show is playing in just a few seconds. Their catalog of shows includes 140 million minutes of broadcast TV, and it continues to grow. 

Download the app for free from the iTunes App Store.
