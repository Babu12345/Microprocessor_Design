  <text>A Facebook app from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) allows supporters to join a virtual Veterans Day march and earn two vets tickets to the Super Bowl. To join the online march, interested Facebook users can simply "like" the IAVA page. This opens up access to the app, which allows you to donate your status or Twitter update to the cause. The app shows a leader board of how many people in each state have donated their statuses. Two veterans from the state that shows the most support will receive tickets to the Super Bowl.
