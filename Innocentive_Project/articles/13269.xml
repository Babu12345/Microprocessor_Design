  <text>Logos Technologies, Fairfax, Virginia, in partnership with the University of Rochesterâ€™s Laboratory for Laser Energetics, has received an award to design, build and install a sophisticated high-energy laser at the Washington State University-led Dynamic Compression Sector at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The Logos Technologies-led team will provide a laser-driven shock compression capability to produce high pressure, short duration shock waves. By coupling tunable, high energy X-ray beams to state-of-the-art shock wave drivers, the Dynamic Compression Sector will enable unprecedented, real-time atomic-scale investigation of materials subjected to extreme dynamic compression. The team will design and deliver a frequency tripled glass laser based on proven technologies, including state-of-the-art beam-smoothing techniques developed at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics. The laser will deliver 100 joules of energy in consistent, accurate and well-characterized nanosecond-scale pulses.</text>
