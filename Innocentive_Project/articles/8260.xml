  <text>The U.S. Air Force has awarded General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Fairfax, Virginia, a nearly $8 million contract to develop an open system architecture (OSA) common back-end digital processor for the entire family of Air Force radio frequency electronic devices, to include radars, signals intelligence sensors, electronic-warfare and communication systems. General Dynamics will use open interface standards to develop modular, plug-and-play, multi-mission electronic back-end processors that leverage technologies developed under other OSA initiatives conducted by the Office of Naval Research. Back-end processors are used to analyze sensor signals-once they have been converted from analog to digital formats-that have been collected by the radio frequency devices.</text>
