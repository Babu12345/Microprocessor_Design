  <text>Raytheon Company has been awarded a $156 million Foreign Military Sales award from the U.S. Army to provide the state of Kuwait with Patriot Configuration-3 radar upgrade kits and related engineering and technical services, which will allow for improved air and missile defense for Kuwait.

Raytheon Company has also received a $38.5 million contract from COMLOG to upgrade Patriot missiles for South Korea. The contract complements awards to Raytheon for command and control, communications, maintenance support, and engineering support for South Korea's Patriot program earlier this year.</text>
