  <text>No more guessing games when it comes to military pay. The MilPay app for the iPhone and iPad breaks down basic pay, housing allowances and special pay using official data from the Defense Department. Plus, MilPay will display how much the user gets paid hourly depending on the amount of hours per week they worked. Developed by MilitaryLounge.com, the app uses information from the 2010 Military Pay and Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) charts and tables. In addition to calculating how much the user makes, it estimates pay for other military positions and shows how income changes with annual raises and rank. MilPay is available in the iTunes App Store. It is on sale for $0.99 from its original price of $2.99.
