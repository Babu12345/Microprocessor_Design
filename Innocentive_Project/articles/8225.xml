  <text>The Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) multiple-award omnibus contracts were extended as a modification to each of the three existing contracts: TASC-M, Andover, Massachusetts, TASC-N, Andover, Massachusettts; and Interop Joint Venture II, Chantilly, Virginia. The three JITC omnibus multiple-award contracts are time-and-material contracts that provide a full-range of test, evaluation, and certification services to support rapid acquisition and fielding of global net-centric war fighting capabilities. The current contracts expire August 30, 2011. The extensions will add an additional 12-month period to each JITC omnibus. The total combined ceiling values for the extension period will be increased by $35 million dollars, changing the total contract ceilings from $1.12 billion dollars to more than $1.15 billion dollars. The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is the contracting activity.</text>
