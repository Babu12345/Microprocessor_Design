  <text>Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems, Tewksbury, Massachusetts, is being awarded a $10,110,934 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development activities associated with Integrated Power Systems power load modules design, and pulsed power loads for future surface combatants. Raytheon will provide the research and development of an advanced Integrated Power Systems power load module that may be used for pulse forming networks that could power future lasers, railguns, or radars. The initial effort will include further refinement of their unique approach to the concept, documenting how the approach could be eventually implemented in a shipboard configuration to meet projected pulsed loads powering needs. The concept will also be used to implement energy storage on the future design that may be used in a multi-purpose manner, allowing the energy to be used for the weapon system and for shipboard powering. Raytheon will apply their unique concept approach to a set of notional performance expectations developed by Raytheon in conjunction with the Navy. The Naval Sea Systems Command is the contracting activity.</text>
