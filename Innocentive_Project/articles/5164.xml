  <text>Perhaps the most famous of military-sanctioned online games,  America's Army: The Official U.S. Army Game allows players to experience Army training the same way a new recruit would. Or, players can jump right into mission action. The game offers a variety of special military positions, such as fireteam leader and medic, that players can attain.

In the Mission Depot, players can post game levels they modified or added. Gamers can interact with one another to create new maps and can vote on their favorites. In addition to the game and all its various support feature including forums, a manual and a frequently asked questions section, the Web site posts information about real-life soldiers who exemplify Army values. The seven core Army values scroll near the bottom right of the screen. Information about how the game is made, what the life of a soldier is like and more about the game itself and serving in the Army is posted copiously.

Of course, the site also links to the U.S. Army's home page for anyone interested in taking his or her military experience and knowledge to another level.</text>
