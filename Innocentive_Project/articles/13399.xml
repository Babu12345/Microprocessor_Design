  <abstract>Have you ever felt unsafe or just uneasy while walking in a certain area? The SafeTrek app, developed by students at the University of Missouri, uses a "safe button" to passively connect to police and automatically notify them if anything goes wrong.</abstract>
  <text>Have you ever felt unsafe or just uneasy walking alone at night or in a secluded area? Many people keep their phones close at hand, but in a real emergency, you may not have time to dial 911. The SafeTrek app for iOS and Android offers a solution.

Created by a group of students at the University of Missouri, the SafeTrek app monitors your location and can automatically notify police.

First, download the app and create a safety profile with your personal information. When you feel unsafe, launch the app and hold down the safe button. Once safe, release the button, type in your four-digit PIN number and exit the app. This halts the GPS tracking. If you're ever in an emergency situation, release the safe button. If you don't enter your PIN after 10 seconds, police will be notified along with the SafeTrek call center. They will use the app data to track and assist you.

Not only does the app help users feel safe, it also helps local police. Police departments have a dashboard to complement the app, which identifies and tracks common locations where people feel unsafe.

Purchase the app for $1.99 from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
