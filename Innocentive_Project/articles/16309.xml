  <text>The Boeing Co., Seattle, Washington, is being awarded $18,116,915 for cost-plus-fixed-fee delivery order 2006 against a previously issued basic ordering agreement (N00019-11-G-0001). This order provides for the supplies and services required to update the flight management computer system software and air data inertial reference magnetic variation tables for the P-8A aircraft. The Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast Out functionality is a Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management requirement that is required for aircraft to access civil airspace and the U.S. National Airspace System beyond January 1, 2020. Work will be performed in Grand Rapids, Michigan (50 percent); Seattle, Washington (39 percent); and Morristown, New Jersey (11 percent), and is expected to be completed in March 2019. Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds in the amount of $18,116,915 are being obligated on this award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.
