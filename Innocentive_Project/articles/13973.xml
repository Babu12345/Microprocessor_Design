  <text>Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Bethpage, New York, is being awarded a $19,082,605 modification under a previously awarded contract (N00024-06-C-6311) to provide integration services for mission packages that will deploy from and integrate with the littoral combat ship (LCS). The Navy’s plan is to use continuous evaluation of system maturity through a disciplined system engineering framework to improve mission capability in identified mission areas. LCS mission packages will be optimized for flexibility in the littorals. Mission package capabilities are currently focused on primary mission areas of mine warfare emphasizing mine countermeasures, littoral anti-submarine warfare and littoral surface warfare operations, including prosecution of small boats. Work will be performed in Bethpage, New York (47 percent); Washington, D.C. (13 percent); Oxnard, California (12 percent); Dahlgren, Virginia (9 percent); Panama City, Florida (8 percent); San Diego (7 percent); Middletown, Rhode Island (2 percent); Hollywood, Maryland (1 percent); and Andover, Massachusetts (1 percent), and is expected to be completed by June 2015. Fiscal 2014 and 2015 research and development; fiscal 2015 operations and maintenance (Navy); and fiscal 2014 and 2015 other procurement (Navy) contract funds in the amount of $2,400,000 will be obligated at time of award and funds in the amount of $7,119,720 will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
