MBDA will ensure the availability of the complete Sea Viper system for the Type 45 destroyer class for a period of six years. The Project Availability Support Service - Sea Viper (PASS-SV) contract is the first support contract let under the Through Life Enabling Contract signed in April 2010 between the Ministry of Defence and MBDA that established a new partnering approach on complex weapons between both parties.</text>
