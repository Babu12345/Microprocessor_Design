  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation, McLean, Virginia, recently announced that it has been awarded a $334 million firm-fixed-price contract from the U.S. Air Force to provide Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) systems and support. The LAIRCM system functions by automatically detecting a missile launch, determining if it is a threat and activating a high-intensity laser-based countermeasure system to track and defeat the missile. Northrop Grumman will deliver LAIRCM hardware and provide associated support to the Air Force beginning immediately and continuing through April 2014.</text>
