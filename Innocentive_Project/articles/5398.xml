  <text>The Boeing Company has been awarded a U.S. Air Force extended user evaluation (EUE) contract valued at up to $30 million to continue testing the Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL), a C-130H aircraft equipped with a high-energy chemical laser and a beam control system. The EUE will expand the envelope of the ATL and further demonstrate how this ultra-precision engagement capability can assist warfighters on the battlefield.</text>
