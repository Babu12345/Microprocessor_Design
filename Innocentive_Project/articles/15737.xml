  <text>The U.S. Air Force’s Long Range Strike Bomber, now designated the B-21, is designed to exploit technologies from its progenitor the B-2, according to Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James. Some design similarities are apparent in the artist’s concept of the B-21 just released by the Air Force.

“The B-21 has been designed from the beginning based on a set of requirements that allows the use of existing and mature technology,” James stated.

The Air Force has made the new bomber a top priority, according to Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Welsh III, USAF. In recent testimony before the U.S. Senate, Gen. Welsh emphasized, “The platforms and systems that made us greater over the last 50 years will not make us great over the next 50.”

The designation B-21 acknowledges the aircraft as the service’s first new bomber of the 21st century, according to the Air Force. A development contract has been awarded to Northrop Grumman, maker of the B-2, for a stealth aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Initial fielding currently is scheduled for the mid 2020s. One goal is for the B-21 to replace the aging B-52 fleet and complement the B-2. </text>
