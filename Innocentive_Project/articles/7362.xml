  <text>The Armed Services Mutual Benefit Association (ASMBA) STAR Foundation is a voluntary group that assists members of the military community by awarding funds to organizations that support them. Grants are awarded to nonprofit organizations that provide services to troops, veterans and their families as well as their communities. The foundation especially emphasizes groups that provide for combat-wounded troops, military families, scholarships for the military community, veterans and patriotic activities. Requests for capital projects and general operating support will be considered. The ASMBA STAR Foundation only funds individuals under specific criteria. It does not fund publications or religious organizations nor does it offer money for tickets to events or special events, political purposes, the retirement of debt, capital projects for educational institutions or multi-year grants for operating funds. Application instructions, information about the approval process and eligibility criteria are available on the website. Information about how to donate to the foundation also is listed online. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
