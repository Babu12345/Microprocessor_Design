  <text>Have you ever wanted to delve a little deeper into your smartphone? With the new Sensor Kinetics app, Android owners can test and monitor all the standard sensors available in their devices. From app developers to students, the app is useful for anyone curious about what goes on within their phone. It allows users to quickly see everything sensor-related, from how fast the accelerometer works to if a device has a gyroscope and how accurately it measures the rotation of angles. In addition, the app's help files include numerous experiments to test these features. The app's main screen lists all the device's sensors and related information, including manufacturer's data, measurement, rate, control and power consumption. Download the free Sensor Kinetics app from Google Play. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
