  <abstract>Twenty-five teams from around the world will face off in the DARPA Robotics Challenge final competition.</abstract>
  <text>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has released a list of 25 teams to perform in the finals of the DARPA Robotics Challenge to be held June 5-6, 2015, at Fairplex in Pomona, California, outside of Los Angeles. Human-robot teams will be tested on capabilities that could enable them to provide assistance in future natural and man-made disasters.

Fourteen new teams from Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, the People’s Republic of China, South Korea and the United States qualified to join 11 previously announced teams. The roboteams will vie for a chance to win one of three cash prizes totaling $3.5 million.

To qualify for the finals, the new teams had to submit videos showing successful completion of five sample tasks: engage an emergency shut-off switch get up from a prone position locomote 10 meters without falling; pass over a barrier; and rotate a circular valve 360 degrees.
