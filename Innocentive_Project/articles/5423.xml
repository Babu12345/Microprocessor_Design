  <text>BAE Systems has been awarded orders worth $66 million by the U.S. Army for continued production of thermal weapon sights. The thermal weapon sights allow soldiers to see deep into the battlefield in darkness and through smoke, fog and other obscurants, helping soldiers detect, identify and engage targets at increased ranges.</text>
