  <text>The U.S. Defense Department has awarded $18 million to six programs to reduce the energy demand of future expeditionary outposts. The assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs will administer the funds, which are granted programs aimed at developing and rapidly transitioning energy technologies for the combat force. Defense Department-led teams representing the military services and the Department of Energy will receive the money but are seeking support and innovation from small businesses. In March, the military and Small Business Administration will host an information session for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Additional information about the teams can be found at http://energy.defense.gov.
