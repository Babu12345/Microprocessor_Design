  <abstract>The military will need more communications capability, not less.</abstract>
  <text>U.S. Army soldiers are adopting Android phones and apps as part of their everyday business, according to an Army satellite communications expert. Col. Pat Rayermann, USA, National Security Space Office, told panel attendees at MILCOM 2010 that soldiers are likely to need more communications capabilities, not less. Soldiers have taken to their Android phones and are winning awards for writing new apps for them, he reported. These soldiers take them home to their barracks at night, where they often use them to review training materials. "They naturally use these devices, they are collaborative, and we owe them an infrastructure," the colonel declared.</text>
