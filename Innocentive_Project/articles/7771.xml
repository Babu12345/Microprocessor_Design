  <text>General Dynamics Information Technology has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Army to operate its supply support activity in Kuwait. The contract has an initial value of about $31 million for the first year, with a potential value of $177 million over five years, if all options are exercised. General Dynamics will be responsible for the management and facilitation of the supply support activity for the Southwest Asia region, which conducts and sustains military operations and activities throughout the region. The company will receive, classify, store and distribute multiple classes of Army supplies using automated information management systems. The majority of the work will be performed at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait.</text>
