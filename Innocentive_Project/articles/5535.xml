  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation has been awarded a task order by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide an infrastructure system and commercial off-the-shelf solution for bed space, transportation and detainee location tracking that will significantly increase safety and security, reduce processing time, minimize network and cellular traffic and provide a common interface for DHS agents. The contract has a potential value of $44.35 million if all options are exercised. Under the terms of the task order, Northrop Grumman's Information Technology sector will provide the DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Detention and Removal Operations with an integrated system that will locate and track detainees, reserve detainee bed space among various facilities and manage detainee transportation. Northrop Grumman will provide the infrastructure and integrate this system with other DHS systems and solutions. </text>
