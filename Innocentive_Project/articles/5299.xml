  <text>DRS Technologies Incorporated has received an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity $22.3 million contract from the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command to design, produce and deliver repair station console (RSC) systems for the DDG modernization backfit program. The development and installation of these systems will automate and integrate shipboard damage control communications, which increase the survivability of battle-damaged ships. The RSC systems will be installed on U.S. Navy Surface combatant ships and will communicate over the shipboard gigabit ethernet data multiplex system network. </text>
