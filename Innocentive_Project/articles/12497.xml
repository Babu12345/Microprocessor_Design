  <text>The U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center awarded Lockheed Martin a $9 million foreign military sales contract to support the Republic of Korea’s Peace Krypton reconnaissance aircraft system. The Peace Krypton system is used for tactical intelligence and is comprised of militarized business jets and ground stations that process data from the aircraft.  Lockheed Martin’s sustainment work scope involves maintenance of the aircraft fleet, which includes spare and repair parts, as well as providing support and test equipment for both the aircraft and its fixed and mobile ground stations. Lockheed Martin will also provide software development and software upgrades as needed to modernize the reconnaissance system. </text>
