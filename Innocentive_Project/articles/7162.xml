  <text>AeroTech Research Inc., has been awarded a NASA Small Business Innovative Research contract to develop a software toolset that quantifies the beneficial effects of equipping aircraft with improved weather avoidance technologies. Â The Advanced Weather Avoidance Requirements Evaluation software will allow airlines and avionics manufacturers to quantify costs and benefits of implementing technologies that reduce the impact that severe weather can have on aircraft operations.</text>
