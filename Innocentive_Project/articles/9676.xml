  <text>The Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization (DALO) has signed an enterprise license agreement with Systematic to extend the licencing of SitaWare Command and Control (C2) software to an unlimited number of users. The Danish Armed Forces have used SitaWare extensively in operations, exercises and training, most notably as a blue force tracker within International Security Assistance Force. The 81 Million Danish Kroner agreement will see the SitaWare suite of software introduced across the Danish Army over the next year.</text>
