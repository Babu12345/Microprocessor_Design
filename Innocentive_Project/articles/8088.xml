  <text>The Pentagon has begun to reassign some organizations within the U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) as part of its planned shutdown as a four-star combatant command later this summer.  Among the organizations reassigned, and their new homes:

 Joint Enduring Capabilities Command to the U.S. Transportations Command
 Joint Warfare Analysis Center to U.S. Strategic Command
 Joint Personnel Recovery Agency to the Air Force
 The NATO School to U.S.  European Command 

Gen. Raymond Odierno USA, commander of USJFCOM, says the "goal is to transfer streamlined, relevant joint functions to appropriate Department of Defense entities." When the changes are complete, officials expect that nearly 50 percent of USJFCOM's  personnel and budget will remain in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, including joint training, joint force provider, joint concept and doctrine development, and joint integration.  USJFCOM is being shutdown as a cost-cutting move by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and President Obama.
