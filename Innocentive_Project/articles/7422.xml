  <text>As the name suggests, AdoptAPlatoon does in fact allow organizations to adopt units of troops to send them packages and letters. But the effort goes much further, including: adoptions of military members by individuals or groups; a pen-pal option; one-time support opportunities; support for special operations forces whose information is not public; and holiday and special campaigns. The campaigns include sending holiday-themed cards and treats at the appropriate times of the year as well as programs to gather supplies for specific needs of troops or local children. AdoptAPlatoon takes its programs seriously and requires certain commitments from its volunteers. The website outlines expectations and includes an application form for those who wish to participate. People who want to help without agreeing to continued activity can make a donation. Funds are especially helpful for the organization's efforts to keep special operations forces information secure. For more information about any of these projects and to access a wealth of information about AdoptAPlatoon or other ways to help the troops, visit the nonprofit's website.</text>
