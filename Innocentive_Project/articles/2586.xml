He leads a flight of 42 military, civilian and contracting personnel and oversees a $14 million advanced programs budget.As part of the Emerald Coast Chapter, Capt. Buzan previously served as the vice president for plans and programs and performed the duties for the vacant vice president for membership and secretary positions. He led the selection process for awarding $1,000 teacher grant awards to three school districts and coordinated AFCEA scholarship nominations across three bases and nine cities. The captain’s efforts resulted in the chapter awarding $10,000 in educational scholarships and grants. Capt. Buzan recently recruited the Dell Corporation as a new corporate sponsor for the chapter. In addition, he organized the annual elections for new chapter officers and facilitated the transition between the two groups. As a result, for the first time in three years, the chapter filled every position. At the AFCEA West conference in San Diego, the captain received AFCEA’s Distinguished Young AFCEAN Award for the Northwestern Florida Region.In recognition of his dedication to the chapter and the association, AFCEA proudly names Capt.
