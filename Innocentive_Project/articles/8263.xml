  <text>An official app from the U.S. Air Force helps candidates prepare for basic military training. The free Fundamentals app for iPhone has tips and information from the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) for current or future active duty airmen. The physical training section of the app features menus for warm-up and cool-down sessions plus instructional videos on proper form for push-ups, sit-ups, running and pull-ups. Other videos teach exercises designed to rapidly improve muscular strength, and the app has a tracking tool for users to record their progress. Users also can link to the Basic Military Training website to view their 14-week workout schedule. In addition, users can learn the Airman Creed and the Air Force song along with rank structure, uniform details and core values of the service. Users can even master the Insignia Challenge game for instant rank recognition. General Dynamics Information Technology created the app for AETC. Fundamentals is available for download from the iTunes App Store and will be available from the Android Market in early July.
