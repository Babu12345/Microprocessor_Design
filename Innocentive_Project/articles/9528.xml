  <text>The free DCO Connect app allows U.S. Defense Department personnel and contractors to host and attend meetings from Android devices and tablets. The mobile initiative is an extension of the existing Defense Connect Online (DCO) program, launched in 2007 by Carahsoft Technology Corporation and Adobe to provide Adobe Connect Web conferencing and Cisco XMPP solutions. Currently, more than 650,000 users across the Defense Department use the system, which supports an average of 40 million Web conferencing minutes and 30 million chat messages per month. With the new mobile capabilities, DCO users have greater flexibility. The app includes two-way video, integrated VoIP audio, chat, notes, participant management, polls, and slide and imagery sharing. The Defense Information Systems Agency DCO team developed the app along with Carahsoft Technology Corporation. It is available to any DCO user, and a Defense Department Common Access Card is required to register. Download the free app from Google Play.
