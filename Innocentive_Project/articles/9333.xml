  <abstract>This app development challenge funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs asks the public to create an app that assists the homeless community. Grand prize is $25,000.</abstract>
  <text>The mobile app challenge Project REACH-for Real-time Electronic Access for Caregivers and the Homeless-is a contest to develop an app that will provide easy access to resources that the homeless, caregivers and caseworkers need. The technology will benefit the wider homeless community and will be relevant for many former service members. The government estimates that more than 67,000 veterans are homeless accounting for about 14 percent of all such adults. The event is sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) through the VA Innovation Initiative.

Contestants should create a free, broadly accessible app that presents real- or near-real-time information about where someone can find a bed, place to eat or medical services. Further details are listed under the competition rules. The submission deadline is July 27. The VA will award up to $10,000 to as many as five finalists. One of the $10,000 winners will receive the Grand Prize of up to $25,000 after the beta test phase.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
