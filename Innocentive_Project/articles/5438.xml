  <text>Assurance Technology Corporation and Lockheed Martin Space Systems are being awarded cost-plus-incentive-fee/fixed-fee contracts for $29 million. This action will provide for self-awareness space situations awareness acquisition, which is born out of the U.S. Air Force's need to provide threat-warning instruments or sensors for the nation's space-based assets. </text>
