  <abstract>Reflection, Hope and Victory in Iraq By Cmdr. Gregory E. Glaros, USN (Ret.)</abstract>
  <text>Our adversaries have shown their willingness to engage, disrupt, regroup and adapt, and the Defense Department has met those challenges head-on. But as adversaries continue to take advantage of global seams within multicultural societies, they will deny a technologically superior force the ability to detect or discriminate. These adversaries will continue to craft denial strategies designed to blunt technological superiority and inhibit forces over-reliant on strike, and they will take advantage of electoral posturing from partisan bickering for the sake of political gain. Legislators who prefer to bemoan casualties but offer no rational solution retreat not just from the battlefield but also from global leadership. Will we as a nation secure stability in Iraq and Afghanistan or assist in its failure?</text>
