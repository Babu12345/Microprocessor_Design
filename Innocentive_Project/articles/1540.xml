  <text>Every year AFCEA recognizes outstanding intelligence and national defense community professionals with two prestigious awards. The AFCEA Distinguished Service Intelligence Award honors senior-level intelligence professionals for distinguished and sustained performance and achievement; the AFCEA Meritorious Service Intelligence Award acknowledges mid-level professionals making significant contributions to the intelligence community. AFCEA invites nominations from government, military, industry and chapters worldwide in appreciation of the efforts of those striving to make a difference in todayâ€™s intelligence and defense communities. Nominees do not need to be AFCEA members. The AFCEA Intelligence Committee, comprising members from government and industry, will select the winners.The deadline for nominations is March 31.
