  <text>Progeny Systems Corporation, Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded an $11,007,288 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification for phase three engineering and technical support services in support of Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Topic N03-220, "Extensible After Action Review Acquisition, Retrieval and Storage System." The concept for this SBIR is to identify technologies that can be used to address emerging non-propulsion electronics system network administration training and maintenance support requirements while concurrently supporting test data collection and analysis requirements. This procurement will use the prototype products, processes, and methodologies developed by Progeny Systems under the SBIR phases one and two efforts. The processes and prototype products developed will apply to air, surface, and undersea warfare combatants. Progeny Systems will also procure analogous technology products that result from the engineering studies and engineering development models as needed. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
