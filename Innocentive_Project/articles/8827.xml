  <abstract>The Asia-Pacific region will be the focal point of this century as nations try to maintain booming economic growth amid longtime regional tensions. Many nations in the area want the United States to remain an active partner in security measures.</abstract>
  <text>The world is witnessing a shift of economic and political power toward the Asia-Pacific region, and U.S. military forces will be following suit, according to the U.S. Marine Corps general in charge of forces for that region. Lt. Gen. Duane D. Thiessen, USMC, commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific, told the luncheon audience at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2011 that nations such as China, India and Indonesia are growing in influence and capability. "The focus of the United States is shifting to the Pacific," Gen. Thiessen stated. "That's where our challenges will be over the next few years. Forces will be shifting there too." Tension is built into the region, and it will not go away anytime soon, the general offered. The reason for the broad economic expansion in Asia over the past few years has been the lack of war, and any tension that would destroy that economic growth would be devastating. Gen. Thiessen stated that regional security and stability is absolutely mandatory, and it is a top priority for the United States. Many countries look toward the United States for participation in security efforts, he added.</text>
