  <text>Stellar Science Ltd., Albuquerque, New Mexico, has been awarded a $7,429,454 cost-plus fixed-fee contract for research and development on the Directed Energy High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute. Contractor will develop a capability to perform end-to-end simulations of all directed energy weapon (DEW) systems by integrating laser source, target effects, ancillary system components and propagation simulations along with directed energy (DE) platform system, engagement and mission level models. In addition, the work to be performed will include basic research and development of underlying DE technologies and integration of simulations for improving DEW system component performance. Work will be performed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, and is expected to be completed by Jan. 24, 2018. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition, with two offers received. Fiscal 2014 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $1,958,828 are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, is the contracting activity (FA9451-15-C-0028).</text>
