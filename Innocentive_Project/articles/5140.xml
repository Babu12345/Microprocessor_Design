  <text>CACI International Incorporated received a $9.5 million contract to provide video teleconferencing (VTC) services and solutions to the Eighth U.S. Army, stationed in the Republic of Korea. The Eighth U.S. Army supports the deterrence of North Korean aggression against the Republic of Korea during armistice, crisis and wartime operations. Under the VTC contract, CACI will partner with the U.S. Army's regional chief information office in Korea to provide VTC capabilities that range from single-user desktop systems to large, multi-screen systems for command center collaboration.</text>
