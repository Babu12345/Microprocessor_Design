  <abstract>Number of U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s PreCheck application centers increases.</abstract>
  <text>The number of application centers offering screenings for admittance into the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s PreCheck program has grown, and travelers can enroll for the PreCheck program at Palm Beach International Airport (PBI), San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Denver International Airport (DEN) and the off-airport IdentoGO Center by MorphoTrust, in Raleigh, North Carolina. There are now 302 enrollment centers in the nation and more than 486,000 registered passengers.
	Travelers interested in TSA’s PreCheck program should pre-enroll online, then make an appointment to complete the process at one of the enrollment centers, where agents collect biographic information, including fingerprints, and verify approved identity documents. TSA completes the applicant vetting process and issues a “known traveler number” to those travelers who are approved. The process costs $85 and the assigned number is valid for five years.
	Information of the new centers comes on the heels of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection app for Apple devices that expedites entry process for U.S. citizens and Canadian visitors to the United States.
