  <text>Helen Mosher and Henry Kenyon have been attending the most recent installment in the AFCEA SOLUTIONS series, "Inter-Agency, Allied and Coalition Information Sharing." Mosher has been livetweeting from panels as @AFCEAHelen on Twitter, and both are blogging here at SIGNAL Scape under the AFCEA SOLUTIONS tag.

Be sure to save the link to the conference because audio will be available later. As it becomes available, the audio files will be linked to the blog posts.</text>
