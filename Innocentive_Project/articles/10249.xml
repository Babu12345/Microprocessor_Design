Maryland is furthering its commitment to science, technology, engineering and mathematics education by hosting the first Maryland Digital Forensics Investigation Challenge. Academic teams of four students from the state’s high schools, community colleges and universities are eligible to participate. Each group will have 20 minutes to complete an investigation from processing a crime scene to testifying in court. Winners will compete for prizes including a tour of the Pentagon. The event takes place on November 29, 2012, at Prince George’s Community College. For more information, including fees and how to register, visit the competition website.
