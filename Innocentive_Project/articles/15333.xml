  <text>BAE Systems, Nashua, New Hampshire, is being awarded a $10,959,664 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for science and technology research concerning full-spectrum staring electronic support receiver (FSSR) with instantaneous direction finding (IDF). The focus of this effort is to design, develop, integrate and demonstrate a FSSR with IDF that leverages emerging and highly innovative electronic and photonic component technologies into an end-to-end electronic warfare demonstration system. The resulting FSSR will be subjected to a realistic, multi-threat electromagnetic environment, including interfering emitters, to demonstrate its operational impact under terminal engagement scenarios of interest to the Navy. Work will be performed in Nashua, New Hampshire, and is expected to be completed October 6, 2018. Fiscal 2015 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds in the amount of $2,800,000 will be obligated at the time of award. No funds will expire at end of current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured under Office of Naval Research broad agency announcement 14-006, for which five proposals were received and five awards were made. The Office of Naval Research, Arlington, Virginia, is the contracting activity (N0014-16-C-2001).
