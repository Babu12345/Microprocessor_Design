  <text>Scalable Network Technologies Incorporated was recently awarded a project from the U.S. Defense Department's Test &amp; Evaluation/Science &amp; Technology Program for project StealthNet, which will provide a real-time, hardware-in-the-loop capability for simulation of cyber threats to the entire net-centric infrastructure. StealthNet is designed to address an existing gap in the Defense Department's testing infrastructure to realistically test the vulnerabilities and resilience of friendly force communications against sophisticated cyber attacks. StealthNet will provide the fundamental science and technology advances to mitigate this gap and includes a transition plan for the resulting capability to be incorporated in the U.S. Army's testing infrastructure.</text>
