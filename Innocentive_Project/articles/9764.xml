  <text>The USO has partnered with Stronger Families to offer the latter's Oxygen Seminars free of charge to wounded warriors and their spouses. The events help couples focus on ways to strengthen their relationships through in-person training and an extended support network.

Several events are scheduled during the rest of 2012. They occur:
July 31-August 1 in San Diego
August 29 -30 at Twentynine Palms, California
October 10-11 at Fort Riley, Kansas
November 6-7 at Camp LeJeune, North Carolina

Anyone who would like to register to attend can contact Jackie Green, the USO programs manager, at jgreen@uso.org or 703-908-6445. The USO encourages couples who cannot attend one of the scheduled dates to contact the organization anyway. If enough individuals in an area are interested, the USO may be able to bring a seminar to that location.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
