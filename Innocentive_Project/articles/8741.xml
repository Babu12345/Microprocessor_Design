  <text>The free Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) Pocket Guide app for Android gives health care providers instant access to resources on improving care for service members and veterans suffering from mTBI. Military and civilian physicians, assistants, nurse practitioners and other health care providers can use the app to find information on assessing, treating and managing common symptoms of mTBI patients. It features a wide range of informative resources, including definitions, causes and severity ratings. In addition, the app includes U.S. Defense Department mTBI clinical guidance and practice guidelines; clinical recommendations on driving assessment after mTBI; consolidated ICD-9 TBI coding tools for providers; and examples of educational materials. The Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury designed the app, and the National Center for Telehealth and Technology developed it. Download the program for free from the Android Market.  These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
