  <text>RDA Incorporated, Doylestown, Pennsylvania, is being awarded a nearly $10 million cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for a Phase III Small Business Innovation Research project for continued development of advanced technology products in the field of undersea warfare research and development, and to transition this technology to the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) fleet.Â Applications to be further developed include acoustic and non-acoustic ASW systems, telemetry and recording systems, signal and data processing, algorithm development, mathematical modeling, prototyping, and analysis to predict the performance of the associated ASW systems. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, New Jersey, is the contracting activity.</text>
