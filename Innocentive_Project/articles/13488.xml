  <text>Common aspects of life have increased in importance as the intelligence community girds to provide an accurate assessment of threats to decision makers. Food, water, energy and disease are moving up the priority list as disruptive elements worldwide, according to the U.S. director of national intelligence (DNI).

James R. Clapper told the audience at the opening plenary session of the AFCEA/INSA Intelligence and National Security Summit 2014, being held September 18-19 in Washington, D.C., that these everyday issues are proving more disruptive on a large scale. Accordingly, the intelligence community must add these to its menu of factors it must analyze and incorporate into its assessments.

Clapper added that the United States is facing the most diverse array of threats and challenges he has seen in all his years in intelligence. As a result, the community needs greater diversity among its personnel. “Inclusion isn’t just about what is altruistically right, it’s about what’s good business in our profession,” he declared.

The DNI emphasized that, if he were to receive more money in his budget, he would devote it to training. Language in particular is the major challenge facing the intelligence community, he added.</text>
