  <text>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is changing its own internal methods of operation to reflect the direction it is giving the services in the move toward the Joint Information Environment, said its director. Lt. Gen. Ronnie D. Hawkins Jr., USAF, DISA director, told the audience at AFCEA’s three-day Joint Information Environment Mission Partner Symposium in Baltimore that the agency recognizes the need to follow its own direction.
	“We ought to be able to eat our own dog food,” Gen. Hawkins declared. “We must do what we are telling the services to do.”
	Gen. Hawkins explained that DISA is working to converge into a single service environment. This will involve all the help desks within the agency, he noted.
	DISA is “posturing its work force for the changing digital [information technology] environment,” Gen. Hawkins continued, adding that changes will be taking place within DISA to help it reorganize for the competitive information technology environment.
	“We’re not going to apologize for the passion we have for moving into the joint information environment,” he emphasized.</text>
