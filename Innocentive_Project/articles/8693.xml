  <text>University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, is being awarded a $10,773,593 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to create experimental serious games to train participants and measure their proficiency in recognizing and mitigating the cognitive biases that commonly affect all types of intelligence analysis. The research objective is to experimentally manipulate variables in serious games and to determine whether and how such variables enable player-participant recognition and persistent mitigation of cognitive biases. U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
