  <text>SIGNAL Editor in Chief Robert K. Ackerman puts some perspective on the Incoming column in this month's "Behind the Lines":
Two years ago, we began a new column called Incoming. Located on the last page of the magazine and featured online each month as part of SIGNAL's blog, Incoming featured a guest columnist providing commentary on a wide range of SIGNAL coverage issues. The past year, the magazine and its readers were fortunate to have Lt. Gen. Harry D. Raduege Jr., USAF (Ret.), chairman of the Deloitte Center for Network Innovation, provide 12 months of his perspective on many of the pressing issues for the AFCEA community.

Our goal has been to rotate columnists with the dawn of each new year. So, with the January 2009 issue, we welcome SIGNAL's new Incoming contributing columnist. Many readers probably are familiar with Christopher Dorobek. A former editor in chief of Federal Computer Week, Chris now is a co-anchor on Federal News Radio 1500 AM's Daily Debrief with Chris Dorobek and Amy Morris in Washington, D.C. He also hosts his own blog, www.dorobekinsider.com.
Next up: Chris's first Incoming column!</text>
