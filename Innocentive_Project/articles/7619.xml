  <text>Flash2Bang, an iPhone app for military personnel in the field, can estimate the range of an artillery shot or the distance of an approaching thunderstorm using the sounds associated with the event.

The app, made by Military Pro LLC, calculates distance based on an observed event and the following noises. Since the speed of sound can be affected by air temperature, Flash2Bang also includes a control to compensate for air temperature differences.

Distance scales cycle between meters, kilometers, feet and miles. The temperature control also serves as a Fahrenheit/Celsius converter.

The tool can calculate a variety of things using noise, including the position of enemy soldiers and the location of fireworks.

Flash2Bang is available in the iTunes App Store for $0.99.
