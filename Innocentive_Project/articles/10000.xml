  <text>Science Applications International Corporation, McLean, Virginia, is being awarded a $58,485,318 cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost-plus-incentive-fee contract to perform Phases 2 through 4 of the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) Program. The contractor will design, construct, and demonstrate a prototype ACTUV vessel. The contractor proposed a trimaran platform: key features and innovations for the vessel, sensors, autonomy and software. This design reflects the results of extensive trade studies conducted by Science Applications International in Phase 1, which validated the suitability of a trimaran platform. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
