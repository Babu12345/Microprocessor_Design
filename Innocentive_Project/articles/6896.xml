  <text>The Defense-wide Information Assurance Program has published an Information Assurance (IA) Policy Chart on the Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center (IATAC) website.  The program's goal for the publication is to capture the large breadth of applicable policies, some of which IA personnel may not know, in a convenient organizational scheme. The IA Policy Chart uses color, hatching, fonts and hyperlinks to provide additional assistance to professionals who need to understand the IA policies to build, operate and secure the GIG. Background notes on the effort also can be found on the IATAC site.</text>
