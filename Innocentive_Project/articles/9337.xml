  <text>The U.S. Army's Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) is on its way to becoming the single network provider for the service, says Mike Krieger, deputy chief information officer for the service.

The command is in charge of half of the service's desktops but has a "heck of a challenge" transitioning the other half. "We may not get it finished on my watch, but we will get it incrementally moving on my watch," he vowed.

He described Army Enterprise Email as one of the best things to happen recently, saying it has revealed much about the Army's business processes. "We've exposed some warts that were probably always there but not that exposed," he said.

Krieger also called representatives of the NETCOM leadership team onto the stage to discuss some of their priorities.

Daniel Bradford, deputy to the commander and senior technical director, discussed the strategic shift taking place from traditional network operations to cyber defense. The effects of the new approach are wide ranging. For example, tactics, techniques and procedures, how warfighters look at data and the speed of response to attack are all affected.

He also said the military must shift from tools and screens and sensors to analyzing what the network attack activity means.
