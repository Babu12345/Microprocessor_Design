  <text>The Irish Naval Service has acquired a NAVIGATOR Diver Held Sonar and Navigation System manufactured by Shark Marine Technologies Inc., of Ontario, Canada. The Irish Naval Service is the state’s principal seagoing agency. The Naval Service Diving Section (NSDS) is the primary state diving team, carrying out varied tasks for a number of state agencies. Members of the NSDS used the NAVIGATOR system whilst training with the Royal Canadian Navy’s fleet diving unit. The NAVIGATOR system is equipped with forward-looking multi-beam sonar to assist diving operations, including search and recovery operations and underwater security.</text>
