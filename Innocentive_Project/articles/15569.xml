  <text>Raytheon Co., McKinney, Texas, is being awarded a $28,173,587 firm-fixed-price job order modification under previously awarded basic ordering agreement (N00164-12-G-JQ66) for procurement of multi-spectral targeting systems (MTS) and data for use on the Navy MH-60R multi-mission helicopter. The MTS system is an airborne, electro-optic, forward-looking, infra-red, turreted sensor package that provides long-range surveillance, high altitude target acquisition, tracking, range-finding and laser designation, and for all tri-service and NATO laser guided munitions. The contract will result in the production and delivery of 29 MTS’s. The work will be performed in McKinney, Texas, and is expected to be completed by May 2017. Fiscal 2015 aircraft procurement (Navy) funding in the amount of $28,173,587 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity. </text>
