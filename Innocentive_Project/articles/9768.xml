  <text>The General Services Administration (GSA) has named Team Veteran Corps, O'Fallon, Illinois, as its selection to provide Mobile Emergency Operations Center (MEOC) Search and Rescue equipment to the United States Air National Guard Readiness Center (ANGRC)/Civil Engineering Division. The ANGRC/Civil Engineering Division is responsible for all facets of equipment acquisition and maintenance in support of key Air National Guard (ANG) missions such as fire and emergency services and explosive and chemical detection and mitigation. The MEOC is a towable unit and is designed to be fully functioning and capable in different operational environments. The contract has a potential value of $140 million over the five-year performance period and supports the ANG mission in all 54 states and territories, including all Air National Guard installations.</text>
