  <text>Innovation may be the key to ensuring that the national critical infrastructure is protected from new cyberthreats, said an undersecretary at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Suzanne Spaulding, undersecretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate at the department, said that the private sector must step in to help prevent future attacks.
	“We need to break through in terms of innovation,” Spaulding told the opening keynote audience at the AFCEA International Cyber Symposium, being held June 24-25 in Baltimore. She noted that most cyberdefenses concentrate on stopping known threats; instead, planners must anticipate what may be coming.
	Spaulding added that cyber experts are moving toward developing attributes that can profile an attack even when it has not been seen before. Other developments are needed from the private sector, which itself is highly vulnerable to attack.
	“We need greater innovation in the context of malware detection and prevention,” she emphasized.</text>
