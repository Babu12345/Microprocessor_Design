  <text>A national challenge is seeking mobile apps that can make public information more accessible to underserved populations. Enter your best solution for a shot at up to $100,000 in prizes. The Apps for Communities challenge is part of Challenge.gov, an online platform from the U.S. General Services Administration and ChallengePost. The site brings together government and public participants in a search for the best solutions to the nation's challenges. Apps for Communities is a joint effort between the Federal Communications Commission and the Knight Foundation. Participants are asked to enter a software application that helps deliver personalized, actionable information to the people that are least likely to be online. The goal is to provide relevant community information to every American, regardless of geography, race, economic status, disability or literacy. The deadline for submissions is October 3, 2011. Participants can apply using the Challenge.gov portal by adding a link to a fully functioning app or demonstration and the source code. The grand prize is $30,000 followed by $20,000 and $10,000 for second and third place.
