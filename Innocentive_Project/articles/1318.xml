  <abstract>Rust Belt Lessons for the Defense Department. By Cmdr. Gregory E. Glaros, USN (Ret.)</abstract>
  <text>The ability of an adversary to launch satellites, make nuclear weapons and develop technology that can defeat our financially glutinous system is no longer rocket science. The pace of change in today’s competitive environment leaves little room for error, and it demands a continual process of reinvention of both the organization and the organization’s products.  But the United States suffers from “affluenza,” a Western disease in which arrogance trumps reality. Given current failures in defense acquisition, the high cost of complex systems and the time it takes to field such systems, does U.S. defense leadership wistfully hope that simple “reforms” will fix its issues? Does the Defense Department even address the right primary concerns? Does it have the proper strategy? Has it addressed what it will take to execute its initiatives successfully?</text>
