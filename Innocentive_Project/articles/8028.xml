  <text>Instantly send free voice messages to friends and family with the HeyTell app without using your minutes. The HeyTell app for the Android, iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad combines the convenience of a text message with the voice component of a phone call. Users simply select a contact and record a message, and the user on the other end will receive a notification that they have a message waiting for them. It can provide a safe alternative to sending text messages in the car. The app, developed by Voxilate Incorporated, sends voice messages that are faster than a text with very low data usage-no more than sending an email. It works with 3G and Wi-Fi, and it delivers twice the frequency range of a cell phone call. You can mark your favorite messages, export them to email or Facebook, send voice messages to groups, and change or disguise your voice. You also have the option to share your location and select one of three privacy levels to control when and how other users can contact you. HeyTell is available for free in the iTunes App Store and the Android Market.
