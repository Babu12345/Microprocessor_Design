  <text>Northrop Grumman Undersea Systems, Annapolis, Maryland, is being awarded a $31,653,045 firm-fixed-priced, cost-plus-fixed-fee, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity requirements contract for depot level repair, maintenance and modifications of the AN/AQS-24 Mine Detecting System to support the Navy for the currently deployed Airborne Mine Countermeasures legacy systems. This follow-on contract includes the technical support, analysis, repair, modification, interface equipment and engineering support and all depot repairs and incorporation of engineering change proposals, including the updates of all integrated logistics support documentation to support the conversions and sustainment. The AN/AQS-24 is currently fielded for use by the Navy to conduct quick response, high-speed airborne mine countermeasures. This contract includes options, which if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $84,520,065. Work will be performed in Annapolis and is expected to be completed by April 2016. No funding will be obligated at the time of award. The contract was not competitively procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)—only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
