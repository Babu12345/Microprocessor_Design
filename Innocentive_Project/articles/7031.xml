  <text>America's Heroes at Work addresses the employment challenges facing service members returning from overseas duties who suffer from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This U.S. Department of Labor project, managed in conjunction with other U.S. agencies and offices, equips employers and the work force development system to help these troops succeed in the workplace. It focuses particularly on veterans of operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. Both TBI and PTSD are common injuries in those conflicts. Though the injuries often are invisible, sufferers can experience headaches, vertigo, balance trouble, anxiety and sleep disturbances as well as cognitive symptoms, all of which can affect everyday activities on the job. America's Heroes at Work engages in an education campaign to increase awareness of these conditions in the work force system and to inform employers of accommodations they can make for these employees. The Resources page has a list that includes frequently asked questions, fact sheets and training tools to help employers. Additional resources such as places to acquire more education on TBI and PTSD, more information on hiring injured veterans and contact numbers are posted on the site.</text>
