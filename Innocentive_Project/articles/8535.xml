  <text>Lockheed Martin MS2, Liverpool, New York, was awarded a more than $91 million firm-fixed-price cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification for four enhanced EQ-36 radar systems with armored Sustained Operation Group (SOG) and Mission Essential Group (MEG) equipped and 16 radar systems with SOG and MEGs. Beginning with an undefinitized April 2010 contract, Lockheed Martin has now received a total of $252 million for a total of 20 EQ-36 radar systems and an upgrade to armored five-ton trucks for the systems' SOG and MEG. The modification completes the funding, on this contract. The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
