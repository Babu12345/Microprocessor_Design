  <text>DRS Soneticom Incorporated, Melbourne, Florida, is being awarded a $10,784,185 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to develop an operational prototype, man-portable signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver to support the Joint Threat Warning System Ground SIGINT kit program. The Tactical SIGINT Tool, as envisioned, will be a small form factor, easily mission configured, secure handheld/body-worn networked device that provides real-time SIGINT and precision geolocation while incorporating a dedicated communications capability for command and control functions and cooperative geolocation. U.S. Special Operations Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, is the contracting activity.</text>
