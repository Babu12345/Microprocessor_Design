  <text>Networking during a major conference can sometimes be like finding a needle in a haystack. The free Topi app for iOS and Android makes it easier to quickly connect.
The app helps conference attendees identify and meet like-minded peers. Browse through people, chat in topic-based rooms, start private group conversations and more.
	The more information you share with the app, the more groups and networking opportunities it can suggest. Log in with Facebook, and the app can connect you with friends and create dedicated chatrooms for events.
	Anyone organizing a conference can access the Topi website and set up the event within the app. Attendees and users simply download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
