  <text>The Canadian Air Transport Authority (CATSA) is installing new fingerprint and iris biometric technology in 29 airports to verify employee identifications. The new system replaces the existing similar application in the Restricted Area Identification Card (RAIC) system, already in use.  CATSA has signed a contract for the supply, integration and data and project management of the new technology. 

In addition, the contract mandates provision of training, training material, and technical support of the deployed application. The RAIC system uses contactless smart cards, fingerprint and iris readers to restrict access to sensitive areas. Employees scan their cards and the biometric data is extracted. The workers then undergo fingerprint or iris scans and that information is matched against the data on the card to verify identification. The RAIC system also enables CATSA to update security clearance information of every employee at all airports simultaneously. Unisys Canada Incorporated received the contract for the implementation of the new technology. The work is scheduled to continue for two years, with two additional two-year option periods.
