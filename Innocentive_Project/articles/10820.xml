  <text>Are you a master at decorating cakes? Do you know all the steps for a great do-it-yourself design project at home? No matter what your talent, you can share your knowledge with the Snapguide app for the iPhone and iPad. It’s an easy way to both share and view step-by-step “how to” guides.
	Easily create your own guides and share them with friends on Twitter, Facebook and more. Just snap pictures or videos, add captions and publish your work.
	The free service from Heavy Bits Incorporated currently includes instructions for a wide variety of topics, including cooking, gardening, crafts, fashion and entertaining, among others.
	The inspiration for the app came when one of the co-founders learned how to bake bread and wanted an easy way to share the steps with photos and videos captured on his mobile phone.
