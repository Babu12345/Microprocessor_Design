  <text>The Shop Savvy app for Android and iPhone lets you take holiday shopping into your own hands-scanning product bar codes to find the best prices online and at nearby stores. Developed by Big in Japan, Shop Savvy can find low prices, shipping promotions, coupon codes, rebates, weekend sales, customer reviews and more with the click of a button. You simply scan a bar code using your smart phone and receive a list of any associated deals. The enhanced "title search" feature allows you to type in a product if you don't have the bar code available. If the app does not recognize a product, you have the option of adding it to the system by typing in the price and adding a photo. The app can also alert you whether or not a product is in stock. It shows a blue dot on a local map next to each store that carries what you're looking for. You can share your deals automatically on Facebook and Twitter. Shop Savvy is free and available for Android and iPhone here.
