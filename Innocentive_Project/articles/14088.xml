  <text>Imagine One Technology &amp; Management Ltd., Colonial Beach, Virginia, is being awarded a $19,280,653 Small Business Innovation Research Phase III, cost-plus-fixed-fee, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to provide an intelligent data-mining agent and smart decision support process for the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) program. The intelligent technology and support process required by the government will supply the CANES program with dynamic planning, re-planning and automation of test procedures, prioritization and optimization fixes based on component dependencies and potential impacts related to configuration changes, machine assisted analysis and learning during verification against design and assisted extrapolation of technical changes into all related technical documentation.

This contract has a five-year ordering period, up to the contract award amount. Work will be performed in San Diego, California, and is expected to be completed by February 2020. Fiscal 2015 other procurement (Navy) funds in the amount of $3,700,000 will be obligated at the time of award and issued as a delivery order. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured because it is a follow-on to a Small Business Innovation Research Phase II contract. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, California, is the contracting activity (N00039-15-D-0005).?
