  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation's Europe-based subsidiary, Park Air Systems, has been awarded a contract by NAV CANADA, Canada's civil air navigation services provider, for the supply of VHF radios as part of an extensive $50 million replacement program. NAV CANADA will replace all ground-to-air VHF radio equipment in 320 sites across Canada. More than 2,000 pairs of radios in total will be replaced with new PAE T6 multi-mode digital radios, which will improve ground-to-air communications throughout Canada, introducing higher power capabilities and advanced remote maintenance monitoring.</text>
