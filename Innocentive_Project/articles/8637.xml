  <text>Go all in to support the troops at the USO of Metropolitan Washington's (USO-Metro's) 8th Annual Stars and Stripes Casino Night on Friday, October 28, from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. at the Sheraton National Hotel. Proceeds will benefit the military community through programs such as outreach to children with deployed parents, support services for spouses, emergency housing and wounded warrior care. Attendees will enjoy a buffet and can play a variety of games including Blackjack, Texas Hold 'em and Roulette. The evening also will feature a raffle and auctions. Entrants can take a chance on winning the grand prize-a weekend getaway to Las Vegas. 

New for this year, the event will include live entertainment, a themed lounge, interactive photo opportunities and the Circle of Stars award ceremony to recognize USO-Metro's top corporate sponsors. Visit the casino night's website for more information about attending and sponsorships.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
