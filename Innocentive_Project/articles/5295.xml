  <text>BAE Systems has been awarded a contract to participate in the Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) $12 billion ENCORE II information technology solutions program. As one of 14 large businesses awarded a contract to support the indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, BAE will provide DISA with network engineering services, systems development engineering and integration, security engineering and enterprise support. The purpose of ENCORE II is to create an infrastructure for--and to provide network-centric services to support--global online collaboration among the military services, the U.S. Defense Department and other government agencies. It will also support the command and control, intelligence and mission-support activities of the military and defense agencies and the Global Information Grid.</text>
