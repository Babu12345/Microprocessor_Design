  <text>If a recipe has more than three ingredients or doesn't require a can opener, I'm lost. Kitchen savvy I'm not, but I do like to eat, so I have to learn some cooking skills to keep my stomach happy. The Betty Crocker Mobile Cookbook can help hungry folks like me learn to create edible, even tasty, recipes. The Betty Crocker Mobile Cookbook is for foodies and food novices alike. The free application features more than 4,000 recipes. It fully loads on iPhones or iPod Touch, so wireless or 3G connections aren't required. Wannabe chefs can search recipes by what ingredients they have on hand or what dish they want to make, or they can choose the "Surprise me" option and receive a random recipe. Recipes include photos, step-by-step instructions and nutritional information. For more information or to download the app, visit the Web site. Like this post?
