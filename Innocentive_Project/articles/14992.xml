The Army and the U.S. Marine Corps are expected to replace the bulk of their high-mobility, multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWVs) with 17,000 JLTVs beginning in 2016.

The vehicle is designed to combine versatility and protection. It features enhanced ballistic protection, underbody protection similar to that of a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle (MRAP) and high-speed off-road mobility. It will be produced in two variants: a two-seater and a four-seater. The two-seater is a utility vehicle, while the four-seater has two base platforms for general purpose and a close combat weapons carrier.

The production contract includes eight option years, with three years low-rate initial production and five years of full rate production.
