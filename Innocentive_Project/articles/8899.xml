  <text>Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) -Toronto, an agency of the Canadian Department of National Defence, has selected the Christie Matrix StIM projection system as part of a major technology upgrade to train threat reaction by aircrews of the CC130 J-model transport aircraft and other military aircraft. Stationed in Canada's new 17,000 square meter Air Mobility Training Centre in Trenton, Ontario, the two projectors are installed in the Department's Hercules Observer Trainer (HOT) simulator. The HOT includes a correctly-sized mock-up of a CC130 J-model transport aircraft with a re-configurable crew station, swappable door and window, overlooking a 1.5 meter radius hemispherical screen and computer-generated images of gunfire missile, and airborne threats.</text>
