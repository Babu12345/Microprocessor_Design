  <text>TASC Inc., Andover, Md., has been awarded a $35 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for the Optical Radiation Bioeffects and Safety (ORBS) program. The objective of the ORBS program is to conduct research on kinetic energy systems to assist in transitioning Defense Department technologies. Research efforts will include the following technical areas: novel laser bioeffects, laser eye protection and advanced technology demonstration, and applied high energy laser bioeffects. Basic and applied research will be conducted on optical radiation hazards expected in future combat scenarios with the view toward development of appropriate countermeasures. Contract deliverables include data, hardware and software. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-14-6519). Â </text>
