  <text>Lockheed Martin Corporation, Riviera Beach, Florida, is being awarded a not-to-exceed $52,741,962 cost-plus-incentive-fee letter contract for the accomplishment of the Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle Reliability Growth Program (RMMV RGP). The purpose of this RMMV RGP effort is to improve the mean time between operational mission failures. The contract will require a comprehensive development and test program that supports the RMMV RGP. Testing shall be conducted to verify the system complies with RMMV system requirements and is prepared for installation on and operations from the littoral combat ship in preparation for developmental test/operational assessment program testing. The RMMV RGP systems engineering effort includes: critical systems reviews and subsequent design reviews, use of predictive reliability tools; build spiral development with in-water testing to assess progress and potential areas for reliability growth development; installation of RMMV reliability upgrades; and all ancillary support. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
