  <text>L-3 Communications' advanced products and design unit has been awarded a $23.2 million delivery order to provide 600 VideoScout-MC mobile video exploitation and management systems to the U.S. Marine Corps. These systems enhance portable equipment currently in use by adding video imagery in real-time, which improves situational awareness. The Marine Corps will receive the mobile VideoScout-MC laptop computer with integrated multi-band receivers. VideoScout-MC captures video and metadata directly from unmanned aerial systems, targeting pods, intelligence feeds and other common sensors and allows users to view, archive, annotate, search, geo-reference and disseminate relevant, actionable video intelligence to others.</text>
