  <text>The CTOvision.com list of Disruptive IThas just been updated. This list reviews the companies regarded as having very high potential to change the way IT is done in large enterprises.For a company to be on the list they must have a currently shipping capability that appears to be a real game changer in enterprise IT. Many companies that were previously “disruptive” in their capability are not on this list because everyone is using them now, so please don’t expect every cool capability to be here. Also, we try to look for more than just disruptive technologies. As pointed out by Clayton Christensen in “The Innovator’s Solution,” the biggest disruptions come when technologies allow changes to strategies or business models.  That sort of disruption is what enterprise CTOs and CIOs look for.  Also of note, the focus of this list is on the enterprise.  There is quite a bit of disruption occurring on the big Internet and in comms markets and elsewhere that is also exciting, but not all hold teh same potential for dramatic disruption.Please look over the list at http://ctovision.com/disruptive-it and if you have suggestions let us know.Thanks!</text>
