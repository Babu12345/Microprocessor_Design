  <text>Raytheon Company has received a $12 million contract from the U.S. Army for the initial design and maturation phase of the 155-mm, precision-guided Excalibur 1b projectile. Excalibur 1b is the next increment in the development of the combat-proven Excalibur 1a munition. The new Excalibur design uses fewer parts and is easier to manufacture than the 1a round, producing a more affordable projectile with enhanced reliability.</text>
