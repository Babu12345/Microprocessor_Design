  <text>Thales and AMST are working together to deliver a new high G-force training service for fast-jet pilots under a Â£44 million contract ($63,065,327). The service, being developed at RAF Cranwell, will improve pilot safety and offer a cost-effective training solution. As prime contractor, Thales will provide the design, build and operation of the training service, which is set to open in 2018. AMST will provide the design, technical and engineering capability for a human training centrifuge, which allows pilots to build and maintain their ability to withstand high G in a safe environment.</text>
