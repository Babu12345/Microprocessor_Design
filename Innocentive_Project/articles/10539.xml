  <text>The NHL strike is over, and amateur hockey is going strong. Defending the Blue Line helps military children enjoy the sport by providing free equipment, hockey camps, special events and financial assistance for other costs associated with playing the game. Families interested in taking advantage of the offerings can learn more on the website. Certain programs and the grants for 2013 open later in the year.
	Hockey enthusiasts who want to help out can donate equipment, volunteer or offer services associated with hockey.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNALâ€™s news editor.</text>
