  <text>Industry is a key player in the Defense Department’s effort to adjust to harsh budget cuts, according to the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr., USN, told members of industry how vital their firms are and how they must meet some key criteria to continue to do business with the department.
	Speaking to a packed house at the morning keynote address at AFCEA/USNI West 2013 in San Diego, Adm. Winnefeld said that “industry is part of our total force.” Accordingly, it must help the department discover and apply innovative solutions to do more with less.
	Adm. Winnefeld warned industry that it must work responsibly, however. He cited security as one area in which the private sector must meet obligations. “Industry must protect its systems against exfiltration,” he declared, adding, “We will stop working with people that don’t.”</text>
