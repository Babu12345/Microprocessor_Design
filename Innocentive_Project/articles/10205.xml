  <text>Logos Technologies, Fairfax, Va., has been awarded $111.8 million by U.S. Naval Air Systems Command to develop an additional 22 Kestrel wide-area persistent surveillance systems to support U.S. forces in the field. The NAVAIR contract calls for the delivery of 20 Kestrel systems and spares, as well as two units for testing and upgrading. In addition, Logos Technologies will provide operational, logistical and analytical support on Kestrel through 2013. With its 360-degree field of view, Kestrel allows operators to simultaneously track and record multiple targets in medium-resolution over many kilometers. Kestrel can also cue full motion video (FMV) sensors for higher resolution imaging. Designed for use on a tethered blimp, the Kestrel surveillance system can scan a city-sized area, both day and night. This provides a heightened level of security for troops at forward operating bases. At the same time, Kestrel can be programmed for autonomous monitoring.</text>
