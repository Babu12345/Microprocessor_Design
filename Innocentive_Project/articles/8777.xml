  <text>Some wounded warriors may no longer be able to serve in war zones, but many still have a strong desire to serve their country. The Mission Continues ensures they have opportunities to do so. It offers several programs that connect veterans and civilians in projects that benefit communities. The Fellowship Program offers post-9/11 wounded and disabled veterans a chance to work with nonprofit organizations, providing tangible goods and services to others. These fellowships usually last 28 weeks, during which participants receive a stipend. The Service Projects Program helps to shape the current generation of veterans into service leaders by bringing them together with civilians and active-duty volunteers in service efforts. The Thought Leadership effort researches how to change the way the nation welcomes home veterans. Information about how to apply for a fellowship, to volunteer, or to join or create a project is available online.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
