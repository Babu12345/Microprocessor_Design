  <text>I cannot function without music. It keeps me moving, gives me energy and helps the day go by. With Remote, you can always have music at your fingertips. The free app turns your iPhone or iPod Touch into a remote control. Wherever you are, you can control the music on your computer's iTunes library or your Apple TV. You can view songs, playlists and album art; create and update Genius playlists; control your AirTunes speakers; and more.
