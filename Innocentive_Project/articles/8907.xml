  <text>SEDNA Digital Solutions, L.L.C., Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded a $13,342,090 modification to previously awarded contract for professional support services to Team Submarine in support of engineering services and support for the development, integration, test, demonstration and certification of a high-fidelity front-end simulation for common processing systems, providing improved technology for Navy High Fidelity Sensor Level Stimulation and Common Processing System in support of USS Virginia class submarines and other submarine/surface ship systems. These services will provide for the continued engineering, fabrication, test, installation, and training services for the analysis, design and, prototyping of components related to open architecture concepts for an improved capability for both legacy and future variants of Navy acoustic systems. This effort includes exploring new approaches to high-fidelity stimulation for testing sensor interfaces and processing, as well as developing new or augmenting existing capabilities as required to meet the acoustic processing needs for the Navy's submarine sonar systems. Technology insertions and advanced processing builds are bi-annual updates to the existing sonar configurations installed on US Navy Submarines.Â The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
