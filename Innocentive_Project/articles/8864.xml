  <text>By the year 2020, Lt. Gen. Rhett A. Hernandez, USA, head of the U.S. Army Cyber Command, said threats from both nation states and other unknown actors will necessitate that the Army truly be an integrated cyberforce.Â Gen. Hernandez presented the keynote address to MILCOM 2011, which opened today at the Baltimore Convention Center.

The general told attendees that he sees a day when the Army's cyberwarriors are integrated within organizations and staffs throughout the ranks, and when the "full range of cyberspace operations will be routine and pervasive" in both combat and non-combat operations.

It will be necessary to leverage and accelerate development of thin, virtual cloud capabilities, and he acknowledged that one of the major challenges is using cybercapabilities to help decisionmakers visualize terrain.

Discussing his "wish list" for industry representatives in attendance, Hernandez said he is looking for hardware and applications that can provide:
"shared situational awareness in a common operating picture,"
"rapid and accurate attribution and forensic capability" to help with trusted identities,
"rapid tool development" to give cyberoperators the ability to develop resources on the fly, and
"clearly defined and easily monitored metrics" to help measure operational success.

MILCOM continues through this Thursday, Nov. 10th, 2011.</text>
