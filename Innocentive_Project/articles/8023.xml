  <text>Designed to educate people about and assist with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this virtual experience in Second Life offers access to several beneficial simulations. Visitors can learn how PTSD can be acquired as well as triggers and avoidance issues and why PTSD is a normal human response. Through interactive activities, the environment helps users learn how symptoms can manifest and provides information about how to diagnose the syndrome and access care resources.

The National Center for Telehealth and Technology (T2) developed the simulation to help veterans and their loved ones anonymously learn more about PTSD. By making the resource available in the privacy of people's homes, the Defense Department hopes users will feel more comfortable, reducing the perceived stigma of asking for help.

To take advantage of the experience, users must create a Second Life avatar. For those without an account, instructions to obtain one are posted on the PTSD Experience website, along with more detailed information and graphics as well as a direct link to the correct region in the online world environment.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
