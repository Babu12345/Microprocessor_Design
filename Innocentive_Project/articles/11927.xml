  <text>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) closed data center operations in Dayton, Ohio, and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and transferred the functions of these centers to other Defense Enterprise Computing centers (DECCs) on October 1. The reallocation of operations from Dayton and Chambersburg enables the agency to consolidate and converge existing information technology infrastructures to gain financial and operational efficiencies across the enterprise, according to an agency announcement. It also supports the adoption of the Joint Information Environment (JIE), a major U.S. Defense Department initiative to provide a consolidated, collaborative and secure environment, which enables end-to-end information sharing and interdependent enterprise services across the department. The JIE is designed to enable secure, seamless access to information regardless of computing device or location.</text>
