  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training, Liverpool, New York, is being awarded an $8,046,094 modification to previously awarded contract N00024-14-C-6227 to exercise options for the production of two low cost conformal array (LCCA) production units, spare modules and spare outboard electronics canisters. The LCCA is a passive planar array mounted on the aft submarine sail structure that is integrated with the Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-The-Shelf Insertion AN/BQQ-25 system to provide situational awareness and collision avoidance for improved tactical control in high density environments. Work will be performed in Syracuse, New York (90 percent); Marion, Massachusetts (8 percent); and Owego, New York (2 percent); and work is expected to be complete by July 2017. Fiscal 2016 other procurement (Navy) funding in the amount of $8,046,094 will be obligated at time of award. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity.
