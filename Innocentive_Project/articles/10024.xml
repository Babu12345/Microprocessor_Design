  <abstract>Honor our Heroes aims to raise $300 million for the four service-branch relief funds that provide direct assistance to military families.</abstract>
  <text>This first WonWorld campaign is nothing if not ambitious. Honor our Heroes aims to raise $300 million for the military relief societies that provide direct assistance to military families. The organization further expects to create an ongoing revenue stream of up to $120 million for those groups. To raise all that money, WonWorld plans to sell 60 million armbands for $5 each. Relief funds and their corporate supporters will help sell the items, or people can order packs containing between two and 100 bands. Each military service has a band designed specifically for it. Beyond raising money, the campaign officials hope to convince Americans to take action to support the defense community. WonWorld's overall goal reaches beyond the military. Officials want to create a new channel for fundraising that brings in hundreds of millions of dollars in different focused campaigns. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping troops, veterans or their familiesÂ please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
