  <text>3 Phoenix Incorporated, Fairfax, Virginia, is being awarded a $14 million modification to previously awarded contract to provide engineering services to support software development, procurement of commercial off-the-shelf products, and hardware/software integration in support of Navy submarine and surface ship systems.Â This effort is for Phase III of a Small Business Innovative Research topic, "Real-time Data Fusion and Visualization Interface for Environmental Research Data." These services will be rendered as needed to support the Navy's initiative to maintain the pace of performance improvement through judicious use of lower power electronics, advanced algorithm design, and innovative applications of open software and hardware. This requirement includes system engineering, architecture design, software engineering, prototyping, integration, and test activities. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
