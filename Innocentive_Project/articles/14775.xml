  <text>AAI Corp., Hunt Valley, Maryland, is being awarded a $10,966,798 modification to previously awarded contract (N00024-14-C-6322) to exercise options for engineering services for the Unmanned Influence Sweep System (UISS) program. The UISS is one of the systems, which will allow the Littoral Combat Ship to perform its mine warfare sweep mission. UISS will target acoustic, magnetic, and magnetic/acoustic combination mine types only. The UISS Program will satisfy the U.S. Navy’s need for a rapid, wide-area coverage mine clearance capability, required to neutralize magnetic/acoustic influence mines. UISS seeks to provide a high area coverage rate in a small, lightweight package with minimal impact on the host platform.

Work will be performed in Hunt Valley, Maryland (72 percent); Slidell, Louisiana (24 percent); Hauppauge, New York (2 percent); Columbia, Maryland (1 percent), and Lemont Furnace, Pennsylvania (1 percent), and is expected to be completed by December 2016. Fiscal 2015 research and development funding in the amount of $1,300,000 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity.
