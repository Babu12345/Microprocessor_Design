  <text>Progeny Systems Corp., Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded a $45,450,000 cost-plus-fixed-fee, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for follow-on support, sustainment and upgrades of personnel systems under the Department of the Navy Tasking, Records and Consolidated Knowledge Enterprise Repository (DON TRACKER) program. DON TRACKER streamlines the DON records and task management to include creating, assigning and routing of taskings. The solution replaces multiple legacy Navy and Marine Corps records and task management applications into a single enterprise wide system, enabling seamless tasking and federally compliant records management across the DON. Work will be performed in Manassas, Virginia, and is expected to be completed by February 2021. Fiscal 2016 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds in the amount of $250,000 will be obligated at the time of award of task order 0001 running concurrent with contract award. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured because the contract is a sole-source Small Business Innovation Research Phase III award solicited in accordance with 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(5). The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, California, is the contracting activity (N00039-16-D-0006).</text>
