  <text>General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Fairfax, Va., was awarded two contracts totaling $50 million to support the continued modernization of the AN/BYG-1 combat control system aboard U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Navy submarines. The AN/BYG-1 modernization program integrates the tactical control, weapons control and tactical network subsystems to provide submarine fleet operators and commanders with a common operational picture that enhances real-time intelligence and improves situational awareness. General Dynamics will continue to upgrade the submarine electronics with commercial off-the-shelf software and hardware that integrates improved tactical and weapons control capabilities across multiple submarine classes.</text>
