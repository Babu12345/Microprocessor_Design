  <abstract>This U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project offers Iraq and Afghanistan veterans temporary jobs working with archeological items. </abstract>
  <text>The Veterans Curation Program (VCP) is solving the mysteries of yesterday by addressing a problem of today. This U.S. Army Corps of Engineers effort seeks to hire veterans from operations in Iraq and Afghanistan-especially veterans with service-connected disabilities-to clean and repackage archeological items. The work helps resolve two issues: veterans' unemployment routinely is higher than the national average and government analysis suggests a backlog of up to 30 years on the artifact work.

Veterans can apply online for positions as laboratory technicians in Missouri, Georgia or Virginia. The work schedule is 40 hours per week, but the VCP is flexible about hours. Employment should last for six months.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
