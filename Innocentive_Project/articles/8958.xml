  <text>Preparing to leave town for a holiday trip? Make sure you have everything you need with the Packing (+TO DO!) app for the iPhone or iPad. The program, developed by QuinnScape, allows you to create unlimited, customizable packing lists. You can edit your lists at any time and discover new ideas and suggestions for packing, including sample lists. Then simply go through and check off items as you go. In addition, you can estimate the total weight of your items to save any potential hassle at the airport and email your lists to family and friends. You also can import and export packing lists between devices (from your iPhone to another iPhone, iPod, iPad, etc.). Download the app from the iTunes App Store for $0.99 or purchase the Packing Pro edition for $2.99 and receive twice as many sample lists, more customization and additional expert assistance.
