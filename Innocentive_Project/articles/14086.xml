  <text>Lt. Gen. Robert Ferrell, USA, Army chief information officer/G-6, has unveiled the publication of the Army Network Campaign Plan (ANCP). The ANCP is described as the overarching game plan that will drive the Army’s focus and unify the service’s effort to optimize operational effectiveness and increase network and information security while achieving increased efficiencies.

The plan is designed to support mission readiness by providing the vision and direction that set conditions for—and lay the path to—the service’s network for 2020 and beyond. According to the announcement, the unifying guidance is critical for providing a modern network to meet the Army’s warfighting and business needs now and in the future.

Unveiled at the Army IT Day conference hosted by AFCEA’s Northern Virginia Chapter, the ANCP is aligned with the service’s operating concept. The ANCP is accompanied by two additional documents, the ANCP Implementation Guidance for both the near-term, 2015-2016, and the mid-term, 2017-2021. The documents are intended to be used together to achieve the overall vision.</text>
