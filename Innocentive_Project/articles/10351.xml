  <text>We’ve probably all had the experience of calling a business and getting trapped in a maze of automated voice prompts—frantically dialing 0 and yelling into the phone that you want to speak with a human being. Well, those days could be over.
	Customer service just got easier thanks to the TalkTo app for iOS and Android. Forget picking up the phone to call a company. With this app, you can simply text any business for information, appointments, reservations or whatever you may need.
	Simply type in the name of a company you want to contact, from stores to restaurants, salons and hotels. Then send a text message just like you would to chat with a friend. The app delivers the message and ensures that you receive a text response.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
