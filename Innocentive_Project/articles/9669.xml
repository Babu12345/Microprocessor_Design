  <text>In just a few short weeks, viewers around the globe will watch top athletes compete at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games in London. And the official Join In mobile app for the event takes spectating at home or in the stands to another level. The free pocket guide includes up-to-date listings for the sporting events and other cultural activities held in conjunction with the games. App users can create a personal viewing schedule based on their interests. In addition, the app includes searchable maps, details on the facilities, augmented reality views of the area, access and seating instructions for the Olympic Park and more than 20 additional venues, and live news, photos and social commentary from the games. Users can link the app with Facebook and Twitter to share the latest information with friends. Leading up to the opening ceremony, users can even track the torch in real time, read information on the torchbearers and see daily video highlights as the journey unfolds. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.  If you have a suggestion for a Cool App-titude feature, email Associate Editor Rachel Eisenhower at reisenhower@afcea.org.
