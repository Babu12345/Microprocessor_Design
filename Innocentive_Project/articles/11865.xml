  <text>See the world from a different perspective with the free Seene app for iOS. Photo apps for the iPhone are a dime a dozen these days, but this app lets you capture 3-D photos of the world around you.
	Seene captures the depth and shape information of whatever you photograph, allowing you to tilt your phone and see different angles.
	Use the app to take unlimited 3-D photos, share them on Twitter and Facebook, and interact with other Seene users. Just point your phone at a subject and move around it. The app builds the 3-D scene automatically.
	Download the app from the iTunes App Store. Users with the iPhone 4S or higher can take photos with the app. Users with the iPhone 4 will only be able to view photos from others.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
