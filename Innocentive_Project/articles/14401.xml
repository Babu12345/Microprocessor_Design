  <text>The Electronic Security Association (ESA), a professional trade association that represents the electronic life safety and security industry, launched a website geared at connecting people interested in careers in the security with companies that are hiring. GetIntoSecurity.com includes a resources section for job hunters, a resources section for career and guidance counselors, and descriptions of the types of security industry jobs available to students, military veterans and retirees. 

The site features a career spotlight section for users to match skills to job titles, including automation consultant, calibration software engineer, security sales, technical support representative or security technician.

"The electronic life safety, security and integrated systems market is growing at a rapid pace, offering cutting-edge technology such as mobile interactive services, wearable monitoring devices, biometric access control devices and cloud-based video surveillance systems," ESA President Marshall Marinace says in a press release.

ESA has 2,500 member companies and 500,000 industry professional members.

Addition information for job seekers, including links to useful services and website, is available through SIGNAL’s guide. </text>
