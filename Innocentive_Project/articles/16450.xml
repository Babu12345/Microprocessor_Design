  <text>SRI International, Menlo Park, California, has been awarded a $7,346,989 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for software. The Threat Intelligence for Grid Recovery is a project under technical area 3 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program. The goal of the RADICS program is to enable skilled cyber and power engineers to restore electrical service within seven days of an attack that overwhelms the recovery capabilities of the impacted organizations. RADICS will develop innovative automated systems to detect indications and warning of an impending attack, provide situational awareness and accelerate recovery actions by enabling first responders to isolate affected systems from the Internet, establish a secure communications network and characterize the nature of the threat. Work will be performed at Menlo Park, California, and is expected to be complete by July 28, 2020. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with 70 offers received. Fiscal 2016 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $1,306,578 are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, New York, is the contracting activity (FA8750-16-C-0179).</text>
