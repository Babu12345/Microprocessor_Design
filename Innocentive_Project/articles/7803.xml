  <text>The mission of Honor and Remember is to create, establish and promote a nationally recognized flag to fly continually as a visible reminder of the lives lost in defense of the United States' national freedom since the country's founding. People who want to support the cause can sign the petition posted on the website and pass the word about the potential new symbol. Other goals of the group include building consensus among various parties to collectively solicit the U.S. Defense Department and Congress to propose and accept the emblem as the official flag honoring fallen troops; promoting national awareness so facilities and private households will fly the Honor and Remember Flag; and presenting the flag to the immediate family members of those lost during military service. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. </text>
