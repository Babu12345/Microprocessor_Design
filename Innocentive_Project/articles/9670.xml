  <text>Every day at airports around the country airplanes land and take off with a rhythm and flow we don't really appreciate until--usually--something disrupts it. But think about all the times you've been waiting at an airport and just watched the people come and go, quietly and with no fanfare. 

On May 23, 2012, blogger Chris Muller was sitting at an airport, waiting for his flight, when an attendant announced the arrival of an Honor Flight of World War II veterans and asked if anyone would mind greeting them as they passed by.

What happened next astonished Muller. As he watched, hundreds of people gathered around Gate 38 of Reagan National Airport to welcome and thank the veterans for their service with applause and cheers. 



Muller documented the event, which struck him as being a kind of unrehearsed flash mob without the crazy choreography or need for advance planning, at his blog.
