  <text>Imagine getting alerts from drivers around you in real time. Police officer around the next curve? A broken down vehicle blocking the shoulder? Now, the free community-based Waze app makes it possible by crowdsourcing traffic and road information to provide drivers with the best route.
	To use the app, you simply type in the destination address and follow the directions (shown on a map and with turn-by-turn voice navigation). While you drive, the app collects traffic and other road data. In addition, users can take an active role by sharing road reports on accidents, police traps, traffic jams, road closures and other hazards. The app uses this data to give drivers a heads up about what lies ahead and to automatically reroute as conditions change.
	Waze learns your frequent destinations, commuting hours and preferred routes and can help you find the cheapest gas stations. Plus, earn points by contributing road information to climb the ranks in the Waze community.
	Download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
