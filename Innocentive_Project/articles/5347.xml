  <text>Lockheed Martin has received an $8.9 million contract from the U.S. Navy to produce and support low-cost conformal arrays (LCCAs) for use aboard submarines. The LCCA is a passive planar array mounted on the aft submarine sail structure and integrated with the Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (A-RCI) AN/BQQ-10 sonar system. It provides situational awareness and collision avoidance for improved tactical control in high-density shipping environments. </text>
