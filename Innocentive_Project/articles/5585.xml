  <text>ICx Technologies has been awarded a $9.4 million base contract by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Contracting Center. The award was presented as a single contract for systems engineering, analysis and the integration of force-protection technologies into the Joint Force Protection Advanced Security System Joint Capability Technology Demonstration. In addition to simple integration, ICx also will be developing sensor fusion and command and control logic-based algorithms to automate and speed up the link between the sensor information that comes in and the resulting emergency- and incident-response capabilities.
