  <text>With the holiday season underway, spending (or saving) money is more important than ever for many consumers. The new BillGuard app for iOS helps you stay on top of spending habits by providing analytics, smart savings alerts and protection against fraud and billing errors.
	Use the app to view your spending over time. BillGuard also searches the Web for coupons that will lower your bills based on spending patterns. You can verify or flag a charge, and over time, the app learns and prioritizes what items you may want to review and alerts you of unwanted or unauthorized charges.
	The app supports more than 5,000 credit and bank accounts.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store. If you're an Android user, you can visit the BillGuard website and get on the "early adopter list" to try the Android version before it becomes available to the public.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
