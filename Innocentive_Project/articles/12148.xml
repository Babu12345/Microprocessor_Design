  <text>Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, Largo Fla., is being awarded a $12,921,937 modification to previously awarded contract (N00024-12-C-5231) to exercise options for cooperative engagement capability (CEC) for the AN/USG-2B Shipboard System and three planar array antenna assembly (PAAA) systems. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
