  <text>Carrier Ethernet takes the dominant LAN technology-namely, Ethernet-and extends it onto Metro and Wide Area networks (MANs/WANs). This potent force greatly simplifies access to, and use of, IP traffic for mission-critical applications and services.

Please join co-presenter Chris Janson, coauthor of the book Carrier Ethernet for Dummies, and Lt. Col Jeff Verrant, USMCR, Ciena's director of DOD business development, for "Carrier Ethernet 101 - A Primer on Carrier Ethernet for the DOD" on Thurs., Oct. 15, 2009, at 1:00 PM ET. 

Attend and learn how Carrier Ethernet can simplify your networking infrastructure while enabling all kinds of interesting new capabilities, including enhanced reliability and availability, simultaneous legacy and advanced services, improved Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and more.
