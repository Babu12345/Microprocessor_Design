  <text>BAE Systems National Security Solutions, BAE Systems Advanced Information Technologies Incorporated, Burlington, Massachusetts, is being awarded an $8,825,492 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification for the Mission-Oriented Resilient Cloud (MRC) Program, which is intended to be a companion program to the existing clean-slate design of resilient, adaptive, secure hosts effort. The MRC effort is concerned with the amplifying effect of the network, seeking to turn this around and use the network as a vulnerability damper and source of resiliency. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
