  <text>A massive directory of Web 2.0 applications and services, Go2Web20.net contains 2,390 site logos as of mid-May. The primary interface for Go2Web20.net is its main page, which lists all of the participating services. By moving a cursor over each site, a quick outline of the service is provided. Clicking on a logo calls up a more detailed description of the service and a URL link to the site. The assembled pages cover a range of interests and subjects, from music sharing sites to professional development and advancement pages.
