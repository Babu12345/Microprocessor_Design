  <text>Members of the military community interested in outdoor recreation will enjoy the U.S. Navy's Moral, Welfare and Recreation site. It lists Navy campgrounds in many states around the country, including Hawaii, as well as in Italy and Japan. Basic information about each campground is provided and links take users to more detailed resources. The facilities offer different accommodations such as tent or RV sites or rental cabins. Other amenities may include water sports, playgrounds and hiking trails.
