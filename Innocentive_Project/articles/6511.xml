  <text>The U.S. Army, Pacific, is pushing technological limits to link its diverse elements. While it has had some successes, it still needs some breakthrough technologies to achieve its goals over the vast region, according to Brig. Gen. Alan R. Lynn, USA, commander, 311th Signal Command. Speaking during the Wednesday breakfast and keynote address at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2009, being held in Honolulu, Hawaii November 2-5, Gen. Lynn outlined his U.S. Army, Pacific, (USARPAC) wish list: -less expensive, lighter, energy-efficient and less-manpower-intensive integrated systems -a smart network that automatically mitigates and or corrects workstations' IA issues/problems -a cross domain solution for multilevel security -and plug-and-play software that enables disparate networks to communicate without information assurance problems. Gen. Lynn also called for communications on-the-move that are less obvious on the battlefield. Currently, vehicles are equipped with large dome antennas that scream "shoot me," he said. He called upon industry to develop higher bandwidth systems that use phased array antennas.</text>
