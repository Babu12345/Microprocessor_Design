  <text>Who doesn't enjoy watching movies from the comfort of their own home? Thanks to the "Redbox Free Rental Promo Codes" iPhone app, cinephiles can enjoy movies at home at a discount--just in time for the holiday weekend. The application provides promotional codes for the Redbox video-rental kiosks found at grocery and other stores. The codes are updated twice a day so users can easily find a code to receive a free DVD rental. The app also has a ranking system that lets users rate the validity and usefulness of each promo. The app, which costs $0.99, is available for download from the iTunes store.
