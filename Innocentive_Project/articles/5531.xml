  <text>In another example of how the military community can receive help through military organizations, the U.S. Defense Department has released a comprehensive handbook (PDF link) outlining compensation and other benefits service members and their families are entitled to after separating or retiring from the military because of serious injury and illness. The departments of Veterans Affairs, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as the Social Security Administration, cooperated on the book's development. Information about assistance from other governmental and nongovernmental organizations also is included.

The handbooks are available in hard copies and electronic versions. Both provide Web sites and toll-free numbers for more help and assistance, and the electronic publication includes hyperlinks. The hard copy will be updated annually and the electronic copy will be updated frequently.


The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
