  <text>Have you ever stood in the aisle of a store contemplating whether or not you could find a better price somewhere else? The Smoopa app for iPhone and Android takes away the guesswork. Simply scan the barcode on the packaging of any item and enter in the price. The program then compares it to other prices in its database from Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Drugstore.com and more. The more prices you enter, the more money you can save. The app rewards frequent users with a random chance to receive credits for each item scanned. These credits can be put toward gift cards, rebate checks or charitable donations. The scanner works on nearly any items, including: books, movies, toys, clothes, shoes, home goods and video games. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
