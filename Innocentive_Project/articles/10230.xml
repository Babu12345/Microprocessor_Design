  <text>DRS Technologies Canada and SELEX Elsag, both of which are Finmeccanica companies, were recently awarded a contract worth approximately $11 million Canadian dollars ($11.2 million, U.S.) by the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada for the upgrading of the Canadian Navyâ€™s HALIFAX Class Frigate Internal Communications System (ICS). The System will be based on Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) technology. Delivery of the equipment is expected to begin in 2013 and to be completed by the middle of 2015. All communications within the ship and external voice communications are controlled through a SHipboard INtegrated COMmunications System (SHINCOM); as part of SHINCOM, ICS includes internal wireless communications technology that facilitates non-wired communications between damage control teams, flight deck crews and 50-caliber gun teams during mission-critical operations. Additional applications include supporting non-mission critical operations and conducting maintenance activities where wireless communications among maintainers are required.</text>
