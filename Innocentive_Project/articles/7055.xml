  <text>The Defense Information Systems Agency issued a bridge extension for three Joint Interoperability Test Command multiple-award Omnibus contracts-two held by Northrop Grumman, and another by Interop Joint Venture II. Set to expire August 31, the contracts will be extended six months with three two-month option periods. The extension will add up to $70 million to each contract, changing the total contract ceilings from $1.05 billion to $1.12 billion.</text>
