The U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has awarded a firm-fixed-price contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation for the fabrication, testing and delivery of AN/UPX-24(V) interrogator sets, the company has announced. Under the nearly $11.5 million follow-on production contract, Northrop Grumman will provide five AN/UPX-24(V) identification friend or foe (IFF) processor sets in an open-architecture configuration to enhance the situational awareness and threat identification capabilities of naval ships. As a core component of the AN/UPX-29(V) shipboard interrogator system, the AN/UPX-24(V) interrogator set is a major subsystem that provides a centralized identification system for ships by determining whether aircraft or ships equipped with IFF transponders are friendly or unknown forces.</text>
