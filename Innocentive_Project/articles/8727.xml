  <text>General Dynamics Advanced Informational Systems Incorporated, McLeansville, North Carolina, is being awarded a potential $86,719,986 contract with cost-plus-incentive-fee, cost-plus-fixed-fee, and firm-fixed-price line items for the engineering, manufacturing and development of the Surface Mine Countermeasure Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (SMCM UUV). The SMCM UUV system will provide the fleet mine warfare commander with enhanced mine-hunting capability.Â The SMCM UUV system will address the Navy's need to reliably detect and identify undersea volume and bottom mines in high-clutter environments and areas with potential for mine case burial. The SMCM UUV will also gather environmental data to provide intelligence support for other mine warfare systems. SMCM UUV system will be a part of the Littoral Combat Ship MCM mission package. This contract will also contain an option for the production of up to five low rate initial production systems. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City Beach, Florida, is the contracting activity.</text>
