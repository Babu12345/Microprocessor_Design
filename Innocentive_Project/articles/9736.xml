  <text>Science Applications International Corporation, McLean, Virginia, is being issued a modification to a previously awarded five-year indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to change the maximum contract value to $500 million. This contract is for the product support integrator for the U.S. Marine Corps Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) Program. The work provides program management and maintenance technicians to support the CREW systems used in and outside the continental United States. The contracting activity orders product support integrator services through the award of individual delivery orders based on the terms and conditions in the basic contract.  Work will be performed in Charleston, South Carolina, Twentynine Palms, California, and Afghanistan, and is expected to be completed August 20, 2014. The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia, is the contracting activity.</text>
