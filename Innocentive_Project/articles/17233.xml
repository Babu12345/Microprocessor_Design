  <abstract>Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems was awarded an estimated $45.5 million modification for an existing contract to produce the Silent Knight Radar System for the U.S. Special Operations Command.</abstract>
  <text>Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems, McKinney, Texas, was awarded an estimated $45.5 million modification for an existing indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with firm-fixed-price and cost-plus-fixed-fee line items for low-rate initial production (LRIP) and full-rate production of the Silent Knight Radar system supporting U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). This action is an order for LRIP II radars. This modification increases the contract ceiling to $200 million. The work will be performed in McKinney and in Forest, Mississippi, and it is expected to be completed by June 2019. Fiscal 2016 and 2017 procurement funds in the amount of $39,155,826, are being obligated at the time of the award. The requirement was synopsized via FedBizOpps, and one offer was solicited and received. This is a sole-source requirement. This is not a multiyear contract. Headquarters, USSOCOM, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, is the contracting activity (H92222-16-D-0033).</text>
