  <text>TeleCommunication Systems Incorporated (TCS) has received $5.4 million from the U.S. Army for satellite communications equipment and services to support military transition teams (MiTTs). MiTTs embed and train with Allied forces in the war on terror and advise the Allied security forces in the areas of intelligence, communications, fire support, logistics and infantry tactics. TCS will provide Army MiTTs with very small aperture terminals (VSATs) with multimedia communication capabilities to convey encrypted voice, video and imagery data to train local Afghani and Iraqi police forces. </text>
