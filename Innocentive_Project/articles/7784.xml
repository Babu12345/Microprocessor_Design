  <text>ACI, Orlando, Florida, recently announced the award of a $2 million contract for the acquisition of 10 TrainAsYouFight simulation systems by the Hawaii Army National Guard. ACI's pilot installation of the Immersive Group Simulation system in 2008 marked the first time a state National Guard unit employed dismounted infantry simulation powered by gaming technology as an integrated feature of the training curriculum. ACI's TrainAsYouFight technology includes weapon instrumentation, wireless helmet-mounted displays, portable optical tracking technology, 60 gigahertz wireless high-definition video technology and 128-bit encryption.</text>
