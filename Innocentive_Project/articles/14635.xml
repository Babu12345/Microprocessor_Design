  <text>Logos Technologies Inc., Fairfax, Virginia, is being awarded a $32,840,745 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for basic and applied research of compact sensor systems that could be flown on platforms such as the RQ-21 Blackjack, Tigershark, and RQ-8 Firescout for the Air Force and Army. The research conducted will leverage previous quick reaction capability efforts in the domains of wide area airborne surveillance, hyperspectral imaging, high-resolution imaging, and light detection and ranging. Work will be performed in Fairfax, Virginia (75 percent); Yuma, Arizona (10 percent); Raleigh, North Carolina (5 percent); Dallas, Texas (2.5 percent); Los Angeles, California ( 2.5 percent); Boston, Massachusetts (2.5 percent); and Bridgewater, Virginia (2.5 percent), and is expected to be completed in June 2018.

Fiscal 2015 research development test and evaluation (Air Force) funds in the amount of $1,710,000 are being obligated at the time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured via broad agency announcement. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, New Jersey, is the contracting activity (N68335-15-C-0148).
