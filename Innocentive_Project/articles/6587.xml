  <text>I can't believe that it's December already and--judging by the parking lot at the shopping center across the street--that the holiday shopping season is in full swing. Ready or not, the holidays are here, and along with them is a fun holiday tradition: the NORAD Tracks Santa program. This year, the young and the young at heart can follow Santa's progress on Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and TroopTube.mil as well as the Web site, which features holiday games and activities. Also new this year, visitors can watch Santa prepare his sleigh, check his list and prepare for his journey on the Web site, beginning Christmas Eve at 12:00 a.m. MST. They can also watch streaming videos of Santa visiting various cities from NORAD's "Santa Cams." 

As soon as Santa takes off from the North Pole, children can track him using Google Maps and Google Earth reports. OnStar subscribers can also receive Santa updates in their cars as they travel on Christmas Eve.

The program's operations center will have more than 1,200 volunteers who will be answering phones and replying to e-mails on Christmas Eve. Children can call the toll-free number (1-877-HI-NORAD or 1-877-446-6723) or send an e-mail to noradtrackssanta@gmail.com. Santa trackers will answer calls and e-mails on Christmas Eve at 4:00 a.m. MST.

Let the holidays begin!</text>
