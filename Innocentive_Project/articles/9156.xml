  <text>ASC Signal Corporation, Plano, Texas, recently announced that it has been awarded a $1 million contract for the first three phases to build up to 100 3.7 meter, X-band antenna systems to support global government communications. These fixed, tracking antennas will communicate with the U.S. Department of Defense's Wideband Global Satcom (WGS) constellation in the X-band frequency. The WGS high-capacity satellite system is deployed across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Ocean regions and supports many military and government platforms.</text>
