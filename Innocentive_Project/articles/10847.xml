  <text>Lockheed Martin Corp., Liverpool, N.Y., is being awarded a $27,399,999 modification to previously awarded contract to exercise and restructure the fixed-price-incentive-options for the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 2 System long-lead-material to firm-fixed-price options. SEWIP is an evolutionary acquisition program to upgrade the existing AN/SLQ-32(V) Electronic Warfare System. The SEWIP Block 2 will greatly improve the receiver/antenna group necessary to keep capabilities current with the pace of the threat and to yield improved system integration. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
