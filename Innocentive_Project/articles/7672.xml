  <text>Applied Research Associates Incorporated, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was recently awarded a potential $11 million contract for requirements analysis for human injury and treatment modeling tools. The contractor will determine the requirements and identify scenarios for use in demonstrating a computer modeling tool for predicting human injury incapacitation, and medical response requirements associated with blast attacks in shipboard environments. The Office of Naval Research, Arlington, Virginia, is the contracting activity.</text>
