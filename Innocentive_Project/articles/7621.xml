  <text>Entertainment, lodging and vehicles may seem like obvious choices for military discounts-but home power systems? Activity duty and retired military members in San Diego County, California, can enjoy price breaks on that, too, thanks to a deal by Stellar Solar. The company wants to show its appreciation for the sacrifices troops make by offering them between $1,000 and $2,000 off residential solar systems depending on the kilowatts needed. The company claims that by combining the discount with a 30 percent federal tax credit and the California rebate, users can have small or no electric bills. More information is available on the website.  Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
