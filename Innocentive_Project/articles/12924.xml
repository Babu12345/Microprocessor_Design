  <text>Sechan Electronics Inc., Lititz, Pennsylvania, is being awarded an $8,734,680 firm-fixed-price delivery order under previously awarded contract (N00024-12-D-5203) for production of Signal Data Processor â€“ Sierra (SDP-S) assemblies in support of the Cooperative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) program. The SDP-S assemblies provide an open architecture assembly to the CEC systems using commercial-off-the-shelf components. The SDP-S provides the core of the CEC system providing processing capability. The SDP-S assemblies are used on CEC shipboard, airborne and land mobile platforms to provide a composite network picture. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force Anti-Air Warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity.</text>
