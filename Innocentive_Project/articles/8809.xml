  <text>Manage your money all from your Android or iPhone. The free Mint.com Personal Finance app brings together all your financial accounts, categorizes your transactions, tracks budgets and helps you achieve savings goals. The app allows you to see all your accounts in one place, including checking, savings, credit cards and retirement funds. Track spending by seeing how much money goes into each category, including rent, gas, fast food, entertainment, clothing and more. Mint can create a budget based on your actual spending, or you can create your own. In addition, you can receive alerts regarding budgets, bank fees, low balances, unusual activity and more. Your app is locked with a 4-digit PIN, and you can deactivate access to the app from Mint.com if your phone is ever lost or stolen. Download the free app from the Android Market or the iTunes App Store.
