  <text>Forget about traditional cork boards and push pins. The new Pinterest app for iPhone lets you catalog and share your favorite things in one accessible place.

Pinterest is website where users set up virtual pinboards based on topics of interest. Categories for these boards include food and drink; travel and places; art and architecture; design; photography; apparel; humor; and more. Customize each board to suit your interests and pin images you find online. These images then link back to the original source.

In addition, you can follow and browse pinboards created by other people. Discover new things and get inspiration from people who share your interests.

The app, developed by Cold Brew Labs, allows you to pin anything that catches your eye no matter where you are-from memorable meals to great finds in a store. Simply snap a picture and pin it to your board, or surf through existing pins and repin them to your own page.

To get started, request an invite to the website and download the free app from the iTunes App Store.
