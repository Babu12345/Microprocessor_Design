  <text>U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) announced that the U.S. Army has committed to a multivendor, multiaward acquisition process—set to be finalized by the end of this month—that will allow multiple companies to compete for the Joint Tactical Radio System Manpack and Handheld Rifleman Radio contracts. The new acquisition approach also will allow the Army to select multiple contractors to each make a percentage of the radios. Prior to this decision, the Army was pursuing a single-vendor process for each of its next-generation radio contracts. Schumer’s announcement specifically cited Harris RF in Rochester, New York, as one vendor that will now be allowed to compete “on a level playing field.” Additionally, the new approach will “ensure the military has the best equipment and that there is healthy pricing competition for the work,” the announcement stated.</text>
