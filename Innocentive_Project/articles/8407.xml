  <text>Raytheon Company, Tucson, Arizona, is being awarded an approximate $18 million contract modification for engineering and technical services in support of the MK15 Phalanx Close-In-Weapon System. The Phalanx Close-In Weapon System is a fast-reaction terminal defense against low- and high-flying, high-speed maneuvering anti-ship missile threats that have penetrated all other ships' defenses. The Phalanx Close-In Weapon System is an integral element of the fleet defense in-depth concept and the Ship Self-Defense Program.  Operating either autonomously or integrated with a combat system, it is an automatic terminal defense weapon system designed to detect, track, engage, and destroy anti-ship missile threats penetrating other defense envelopes.  The Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems are installed on approximately 187 Navy ships and used by more than 20 foreign militaries. This contract combines purchases for the United States government and the governments of Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan under the Foreign Military Sales Program. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
