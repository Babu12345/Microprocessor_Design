  <text>Northrop Grumman Space and Mission Systems, Redondo Beach, California, is being awarded a $9,035,520 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Nitride Electronic Next Generation Technology Program. The performer will develop device and integration technologies necessary to realize enhancement and depletion mode nitride transistors that simultaneously provide extremely high-speed and high-voltage operation in a process consistent with large-scale integration in circuits of 1,000 or more transistors. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
