  <text>ManTech International Corporation recently announced that it has received a task order under its Strategic Services Sourcing prime contract to provide Base Expeditionary Target Surveillance Systems-Combined (BETSS-C) operators in Iraq. The multiple-award task order, in support of the U.S. Army's Project Manager Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition, has an expected value to ManTech of $70 million if all contract options are exercised. ManTech will provide BETSS-C operators and related administrative, managerial, logistics and business services necessary to support their deployment to Iraq. BETSS-C enhances perimeter surveillance, battle command and force protection at joint security stations, forward-operating bases and combat outposts throughout Iraq.</text>
