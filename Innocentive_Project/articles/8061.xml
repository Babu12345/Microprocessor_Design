  <text>This free iPhone app provides information and tools for veterans and service members suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, PTSD Coach is ideal for tracking symptoms, handling stress and finding help even when you're on the go. The app gives users information about professional care, commonly asked questions about the disorder and tips to manage stress in daily life. PTSD Coach allows users to personalize their mobile experience with contacts, photos and music. According to developers, the app can be used by people who are in treatment as well as those who are not. The app is free for download in the iTunes App Store. An Android version will be available in late Spring 2011 along with a PTSD Family Coach app coming soon.
