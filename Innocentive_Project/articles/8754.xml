  <text>The Norwegian Defense Ministry has decided to purchase NORMANS digitized soldier system based on the concept that has been designed and tested at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment. NORMANS digitized soldier system will provide Norwegian soldiers with improved situational awareness, improved ability to navigate and effective mission planning. As the prime contractor, Thales Norway will be responsible for delivering information systems to Norwegian soldiers over a five-year period.</text>
