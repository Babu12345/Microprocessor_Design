  <abstract>Agility is a common attribute to smaller individuals. Large technology companies are taking note and restructuring accordingly.</abstract>
  <text>The secret to success as a technology firm may be to reduce its size, said the CEO of one of the biggest information system companies. Meg Whitman, president and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, outlined that philosophy to the Thursday luncheon audience at Defensive Cyber Operations Symposium (DCOS) 2016, being held in the Washington, D.C., convention center, April 20-22.

Whitman split her company into two parts: one manufacturing computer and printer hardware, the other focusing on information system services. She ascribed that action to the needs of an increasingly fast-changing high-technology sector.

“The future of every organization is going to belong to the fast, and we have to get smaller to be fast,” Whitman told the audience as she was interviewed by Terry Halvorsen, Defense Department chief information officer. “Our customers say they’re already seeing greater agility," she added.

The same holds true for data centers, she pointed out. As the reliance on the cloud increases, so does the potential for enormous data centers. Calling for smaller data centers, she suggested that the computer data center is going to move to the edge as opposed to remaining in a fixed location.

“How do we have much lower power, much smaller space that allows us to compute the way we want to?” she asked.
