  <text>U.S. Army officials are laboring to define what the force will look like in 2025. But technologically speaking, it is hard to define anything beyond the next two or three years, said Lt. Gen. Edward Cardon, USA, commanding general, U.S. Army Cyber Command, during AFCEA TechNet Augusta held Sept. 9-11, Augusta, Georgia.

“This is a major effort inside the Army. I believe we’re sitting in the midst of an information technology revolution. The revolution, to me, is being driven by cloud technologies, virtualization technologies, big data technologies, wireless and mobile technologies, and advanced computing technologies to include quantum computing,” Gen. Cardon asserted. “When you take all of those together, it becomes very hard to predict the tech environment two to three years from now.”

The general reported visiting Google and speaking with the leading software engineer, who stated that two to three years is about as far as technologists can predict. “Their interpretation of the space is that every layer of the network stack is under transformation as we speak and is converging,” he said.</text>
