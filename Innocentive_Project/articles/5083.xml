  <text>From July's SIGNAL Today, some interesting quotes from the July issue of SIGNAL Magazine.

"Solving IEDs in some ways will be as difficult as solving the problem of bullets.  Bullets have been in use for centuries, and we still have not completely solved that [weapon] as a wartime threat."-Dr. Robert L. Keesee, deputy director of the Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO), 
in Improvised Explosive Devices a Multifaceted Threat

"There are already lots of networks out there. What you need to do is connect the ones that exist."-David Aylward, director, ComCare Alliance, in First Responders, Hospitals Need More Bandwidth

"This is tough work. But it is relevant, it is vital, and most importantly, it is what we need to do to make a positive, lasting difference for the people of Iraq."-Col. Karlton Johnson, USAF, J-6, Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I), in Dependable Communications Systems Boost Iraqi Systems
