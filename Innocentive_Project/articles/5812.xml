  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation is developing a robust, radiation-hardened, wireless spacecraft bus under a $4.1 million first-phase contract from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). A spacecraft data bus serves as the electrical interface between the spacecraft's equipment and payloads. Under the contract, Northrop Grumman will develop a wireless data bus interface that enhances AFRL's innovative electronics architecture for spacecraft called Space Plug-n-Play Avionics, or SPA.</text>
