  <text>The Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (DCoE) launched  Real Warriors in 2007 to help returning service members, veterans and their loved ones deal with invisible wounds such as traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. This program spreads the word about available resources as well as produces stories about troops who have sought treatment for these often-stigmatized problems and gone on to successful military or civilian careers.

Recently, the DCoE made a stronger push in the social-media realm to connect the wounded and further promote resources. In addition to opening Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TroopTube accounts, Real Warriors is using Digg, Delicious and StumbleUpon as well as various message boards. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
