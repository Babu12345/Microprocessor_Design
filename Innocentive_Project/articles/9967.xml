  <text>You don't need a professional camera to snap and share high-quality photos with family and friends thanks to the free Camera Awesome app for iOS, which ranks as the number one photography app in 55 countries. The program, developed by SmugMug, gives iPhone users more control over the phone's camera and offers a series of filters and processing tools. It shoots faster to produce sharper, better-exposed images. Simply snap photos, apply hundreds of professional effects, filters and borders, and share the shots through Facebook, Twitter, email, Flickr and more with one tap. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
