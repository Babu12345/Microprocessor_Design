LGS Innovations, Herndon, Va., recently announced it has been awarded a contract worth just over $49 million to upgrade the U.S. Army’s Main Communications Facility (MCF) in Southwest Asia. The MCF, designed as a state-of-the-art commercial communications operations center, will serve as the central information systems hub for the region. The MCF will house 9,000 square feet of usable equipment room space and will be capable of multiplexing and de-multiplexing circuits transported over copper, fiber, satellite, or terrestrial line of sight radios. LGS will engineer, furnish, install, test, and secure the Army’s extensive network, transmission, and voice infrastructure in Southwest Asia. The company has also been tasked to execute a critical cutover of transmission circuits as well as design, develop, furnish, and install a virtualized infrastructure to accommodate the migration of servers and their applications from existing facilities to the MCF.</text>
