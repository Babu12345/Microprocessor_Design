  <text>The Dragon Dictation app for iPhone and iPad and the FlexT9 app for Android let you speak and instantly see your words transcribed into text or email messages. These voice recognition programs, developed by Nuance Communications Incorporated, create messages five times faster than typing on a keyboard. Simply hit record and speak your message, then watch as the app instantly transforms your voice into text using the Dragon Naturally Speaking tool. The apps not only create text and email messages, but they can use your voice to update your status on Facebook or Twitter and to set reminders. The apps also can securely access your contact list and recognize the names of your friends and colleagues as you speak. In addition, the programs support a variety of global languages. Download the Dragon Dictation app for free from the iTunes App Store or purchase the FlexT9 app for $4.99 from the Android Market. The Android app contains additional features to switch between speak, trace, write and tap modes.
