  <text>CareerOneStop is accessible through the HireVetsFirst site, but companies seeking veterans and veterans seeking employment can save time by going directly to the military transition section. The main page features links to more information about obtaining credentials, certification and licenses, locating a job, planning education and training, transitioning to civilian life, financial resources, local services and disabled/injured resources. Another page offers help for civilian spouses hunting for jobs. Veterans searching for local help can use a search tool to find employment, educational, National Guard/Reserve and homeless veteran information organized by state. The Businesses page includes a tool to help write job descriptions, a military-to-civilian occupation translator and tips for recruiting veterans. CareerOneStop also has 3,400 One-Stop Career Centers around the United States that help connect employers and veterans. These locations offer specialized local Veterans' Employment Representatives and Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program staff. Site visitors can use the locator tool to find offices near them. The centers recruit, screen and refer veterans from entry-level workers to skilled professionals.</text>
