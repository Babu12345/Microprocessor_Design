  <text>This nonprofit, nonpolitical organization is dedicated to providing professional development to women in all three of the U.S. maritime armed forces-the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Established in 1978, the Sea Service Leadership Association (SSLA) offers networking, education and mentorship opportunities. The association holds various events throughout the year, including the Women's Leadership Symposium, which will take place on March 15 and 16 in San Diego. Attendees can register online until March 7, 2011. The theme is "Connect. Empower. Succeed." The symposium will offer attendees an opportunity to focus on their leadership abilities and will highlight the achievements of women leaders on the front lines. More information about the conference is available on the website, where visitors also can learn about membership, chapters and SSLA leaders.</text>
