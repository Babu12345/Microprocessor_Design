  <text>General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems has been awarded a $14 million task order by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to support the National Communications System (NCS). General Dynamics will provide around-the-clock watch operations for critical communications infrastructure through support of the NCS's National Coordinating Center (NCC) for Communications. The company will provide emergency response support and liaison to communications partners to identify the possible impacts of potentially disruptive events and coordinate the restoration and repair of the infrastructure when outages occur. The NCC Watch assists NCS in executing its roles and responsibilities under Executive Order 12472 for support of the National Command Authority and for planning, developing and implementing enhancements to the national communications infrastructure. The NCC Watch facilitates collaboration among the NCC communications industry and government partners to support information sharing and collaboration, while performing analysis of the national communications infrastructure. Due to the confluence of technologies, the NCC Watch responds to cyber security incidents and events in tandem with its sister organization, the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), under event coordination by the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC).</text>
