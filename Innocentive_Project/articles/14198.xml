  <text>L-3 National Security Solutions Inc., Reston, Virginia, is being awarded a $54,518,564 modification to a previously awarded indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract (with provisions for firm-fixed-price orders) (N65236-11-D-4805). This ceiling increase is to provide for continued engineering and technical support services for command, control, communications and computer (C4) exercise planning and evaluation, integration, systems integration, operational systems, fielding, training, certification, maintenance, logistics, configuration management, systems engineering, network engineering, software engineering, documentation/graphics support, program management, quality assurance and life-cycle sustainment management support. 

This contract included four options which, as a result of this modification, would bring the cumulative ceiling value of this contract to $136,247,954. Work will be performed in Fayetteville, North Carolina, (84 percent) and Tampa, Florida, (16 percent) and is expected to be completed by September 2016. No contract funds will be obligated at the time of award. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. 

This contract was previously competitively procured with proposals solicited via the Commerce Business Daily's Federal Business Opportunities website, and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command e-Commerce Central website, with three offers received. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic, Charleston, South Carolina, is the contracting activity (N65236-11-D-4805).
