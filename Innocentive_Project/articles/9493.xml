  <text>BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration, Incorporated, Nashua, New Hampshire, is being awarded a $20,596,718 modification to a previously awarded cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for technology maturation efforts in support of the next-generation jammer, which will replace the aging ALQ-99 tactical jamming system. Technology maturation efforts include research in support of future development of airborne electronic attack capability from a tactical-size airborne stand-off/mod-escort platform. Specifically, the contractor will mature and provide a concept demonstrator (CD) design and mature critical technology elements required to support CD design. Other awards include: Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Integrated Systems - Eastern Region, Bethpage, New York, $20,220,599; and ITT Exelis, Clifton, New Jersey, $20,175,204. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
