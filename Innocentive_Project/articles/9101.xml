  <text>SELEX Sistemi Integrati recently signed two contracts with the Italian Ministry of Defence to support forces in Afghanistan. The first contract concerns the strengthening of the protection level for the forward operating bases and the forward support bases in service in Afghanistan. SELEX Sistemi Integrati will deliver surveillance integrated systems which include the man-portable LYRA10 radar and several electro-optical sensors. The supply also includes the creation of command and surveillance posts for the systems management, surveillance systems for airport areas, camera integrated systems for the internal surveillance of entrances, robotic systems in combat version for the protection of the bases and acoustic systems able to locate the fire sources. The second contract signed is relevant to the strengthening of some of the operational functionalities of the command and control system for the Italian Army (SIACCON2) and the related connective infrastructure (mission network) at the moment in use in Afghanistan by the Italian Armed Forces. The upgrade will allow them to operate with higher efficiency and wider interoperability in the complex multinational mission which is in course in the country.</text>
