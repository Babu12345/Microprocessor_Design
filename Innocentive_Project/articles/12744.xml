  <text>Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies Lab, Cherry Hill, N.J., has been awarded a $13,362,252 modification (P00016) to previously awarded contract (HR0011-11-C-0033) to incorporate new add work, Phase 3, to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) program. The modification brings the estimated face value of the contract to $29,367,326 from $16,005,074. The objectives of the Phase 3 BLADE program are to refine and technically mature algorithms and software developed during Phase 2 of the program and to apply them in tactically relevant environments and timeframes on tactical military electronic attack platforms. The program will culminate in over-the-air and on-the-move testing and valuation of the BLADE system in an operationally representative environment. The contracting activity is DARPA, Arlington, Virginia.</text>
