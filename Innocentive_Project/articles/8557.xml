  <text>Military OneSource allows all levels of filmmakers to flex their skills to help military families and  groups get or stay connected. This Defense Department-only site allows people to post videos in much the same way that YouTube does for the general public. TroopTube enables people at home to create clips for their deployed loved ones or organizations to create professional videos that inform viewers about happenings around the department. Getting started is easy. Simply sign in using a Military OneSource account and start uploading.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
