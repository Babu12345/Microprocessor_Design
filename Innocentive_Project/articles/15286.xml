  <text>DRS Laurel Technologies, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, is being awarded a $17,034,664 firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the Common Processing System (CPS) Technology Insertion 16 production. The CPS equipment procurement provides a processing and storage system that supports the Navy’s planned implementation of open architecture for Navy combat systems. Technical requirements were originally driven by the Aegis-modernization program of record but have been expanded to include the requirements of Aegis new-ship construction, Ship Self Defense System, Aircraft Carrier Tactical Support Center and the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program. The CPS provides computer processing and memory, data storage and extraction, and input/output interfaces to support host software applications of Navy combat systems. This contract includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $474 million. Work will be performed in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and is expected to be completed by July 2016. Fiscal 2015 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding in the amount of $4,576,149 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured, full and open solicitation via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with five offers received. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity (N00024-15-D-5201).</text>
