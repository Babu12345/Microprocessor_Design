  <text>PacStar has announced it has been awarded a three-year, $6.2 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to support the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical Increment 1 (WIN-T). The WIN-T contract significantly expands the use of PacStar’s IQ-Core Software by mobile network communications units across the U.S. Army. IQ-Core Software delivers communications management by replacing time-intensive, complex and error-prone manual set-up and management processes for battlefield tactical communications systems with configuration wizards that automate both complex and routine tasks. </text>
