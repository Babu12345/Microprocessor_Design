  <text>?Northrop Grumman Inc., Woodland Hills, California, is being awarded a $12,479,046 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, firm-fixed-price contract for the repair, overhaul and provision of spare components for the mast motion sensor (MMS), an inertial navigation device, in support of the Submarine High Data Rate Antenna System (SubHDR) mast group. The MMS is a vital part of the SubHDR. The SubHDR antenna system provides high-capacity communications to submarines in the super high frequency and extremely high frequency spectrums. The system consists of both the inboard Navy Satellite Program terminal, and associated equipment and outboard (antenna) components. This contract combines purchases for the Navy (63 percent) and the government of the United Kingdom (38 percent) under the Foreign Military Sales program. Work will be performed in Salt Lake City, Utah, and is expected to be completed by September 2020. Fiscal 2015 operations and maintenance (Navy) funding in the amount of $443,224 and foreign military sales funding in the amount of $225,315 will be obligated at time of award. Contract funds in the amount of $443,224 will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1–only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, Newport, Rhode Island, is the contracting activity (N66604-15-D-1504).</text>
