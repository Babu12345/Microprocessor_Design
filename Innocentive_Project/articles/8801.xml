  <text>Birdies for the Brave is a PGA Tour Charities program that raises money for organizations established to support the military community. The effort involves several types of activities such as letter writing, distributing care packages and fundraising golf tournaments conducted at a network of golf clubs across the United States.

Two tournaments take place today in Potomac, Maryland, and Princeton, New Jersey, but anyone who can't make those has many more chances to participate. Between November 2 and December 12, 11 additional tournaments are scheduled. The complete list and information about each event can be found online.

The Birdies for the Brave website also includes information about the organizations it supports as well as a page featuring tour players who assist military charities and which ones.</text>
