  <abstract>Put human ease of use ahead of showing what technology can do.</abstract>
  <text>The co-founder of Apple Computer told a MILCOM 2010 plenary address audience that the key to designing new technology systems is to put the human ahead of the technology. "How do you make products that are so good and easy to use?" Steve Wozniak offered. "If the technology is the most important, you pile on technology and force people to learn it. If the human is most important, you make the software work the human way." Wozniak related how an early inspiration came from a visit to Xerox PARC, where he first saw the mouse and icon human interface. That became the basis for Apple's Macintosh operating system that now defines the company's desktop and laptop line of computers.</text>
