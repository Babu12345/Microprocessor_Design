  <text>The goal of reQall is to serve as a memory tool. The site collects and aggregates personal data. Users can access the site through a variety of methods, such as text from a handheld or desktop computer or voice from a telephone. The site will translate voice messages into text and store the data. Users with iPhones or Web access can quickly enter action items and clip and remember items on the home page. ReQall can contain anything from personal notes to contact lists and photographs. A memory jogger feature lets users play games especially designed to strengthen memory.
