  <abstract>Team Rubicon forms groups of veterans and medical personnel to respond during crisis scenarios. </abstract>
  <text>Team Rubicon is an organization helping veterans help more people. It offers former troops who have a desire to continue serving others a chance to use their unique skill sets during disaster response scenarios. The veterans are teamed with medical personnel and deployed to areas worldwide that are experiencing crises. Response events can be reactive, responding to an immediate, devastating emergency, or proactive in areas with ongoing problems.

Veterans and medical personnel volunteer their time to Team Rubicon, and the organization pays for all expenses. In certain situations, people with other skills, such as fundraising, are asked to help as well. People interested in participating can learn more in the Volunteer FAQ or fill out an application.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping troops, veterans or their familiesÂ please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
