  <text>Leidos Inc., Reston, Virginia, has been awarded an $18,745,838 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development. This contract aims to dramatically improve the ability to detect and geolocate high frequency emitters. The previous phase, Phase 1, of the program addressed technical innovations to accomplish this objective, including the ability to accurately resolve multiple angles-of-arrival and polarization states through novel antenna concepts; the ability to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and signal detection through the use of multi-dimensional adaptive signal processing; and the ability to accurately determine the dynamic state of the ionosphere. Phase 2 includes system integration of these innovations followed by a non-real-time field test. Phase 3 will be real-time implementation and demonstration with field testing. Phase 2 will be 18 months, and Phase 3 will be 15 months in duration. Phase 2 provides the transition from the key technologies of Phase 1 to the development of a prototype system of hardware and off-line signal processing for use in initial field tests with surrogate targets. Phase 3 will implement real-time signal processing, incorporate signal processing enhancements and test against realistic targets in realistic environments. Work will be performed at Reston, Virginia, and is expected to be complete by Aug. 25, 2018. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with seven offers received. Fiscal 2014 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $10,454,868 are being obligated at the time of award. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-15-C-9103).
