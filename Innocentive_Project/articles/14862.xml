  <text>Rockwell Collins Inc., Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is being awarded $8,131,791 for cost-plus-fixed-fee delivery order 0006 against a previously issued basic ordering agreement (N00019-14-G-0021) for engineering integration efforts on the Digital Red Switch System (DRSS) in support of one E-6B Mercury aircraft. This DRSS modification will provide enhanced distribution of audio from mission radios and includes efforts in the systems integration lab. Work will be performed in Richardson, Texas (80 percent); and Patuxent River, Maryland (20 percent), and is expected to be completed in November 2017. Fiscal 2014 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds in the amount $6,491,321 will be obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
