  <text>Avarint LLC, Buffalo, New York, has been awarded an $83,740,389 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost reimbursement contract for Virtual Integrated Electronic Warfare Simulations (VIEWS) II. Contractor will provide an integrated, multi-spectral, virtual battlespace environment suitable for the test and evaluation of advanced sensor, fused system performance. Continuous advancements in survivability technologies necessitate improvements to ground and open-air test capabilities, with particular focus on the areas of sensors and avionics architectures that fuse information from multiple sources including the F-22 and F-35. The electronic warfare test and evaluation infrastructure must keep pace with advances in technology and new employment concepts. 

Work will primarily be performed at Buffalo, New York, and at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and is expected to be complete by March 26, 2020. This award is the result of a sole-source acquisition. Fiscal 2015 research, development, test and evaluation, operations and maintenance and procurement funds in the amount of $180,000 are being obligated at the time of award. Air Force Test Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California, is the contracting activity (FA9302-15-D-0004).</text>
