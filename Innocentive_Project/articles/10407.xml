  <text>Sandia National Laboratories has created a hiring program that helps wounded warriors get into the work force and develop career-based skills and experience. Under the Wounded Warrior Working Group, Sandia hires qualified applicants for one to three years, which could lead to permanent employment. Executive, technical and veteran mentors are a key component of the program. Applicants can be separated from the service for any length of time. While a college degree is not required, Sandia expects those chosen to participate in the program to pursue higher education while working at the laboratories. Additional information about the program is available at http://woundedwarrior.sandia.gov and view all jobs. Enter the keyword “Warrior” to see current job openings.</text>
