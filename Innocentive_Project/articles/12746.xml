  <text>General Dynamics C4 Systems received a $59 million contract from the U.S. Army for new Warfighter Information Network–Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 2 vehicles and related network products to support Army soldier training. The new equipment, which includes soldier network extension and point-of-presence vehicles, will have updated software that simplifies network operations. When delivered to the Army’s LandWarNet School in Fort Gordon, Georgia, the vehicles and products will be folded into the Army’s new system-of-systems training curriculum. </text>
