  <text>It's the holidays-time to build up that stash of generic gifts for parties, both business and personal. A bottle of wine is always a nice gesture--unless, like me, you know nothing about wine. The following applications can help make navigating the world of wine a bit easier. For BlackBerry fans, the Wine &amp; Food Guide can help users purchase a wine or select one to pair with a meal. It features sections for wine descriptions such as red, white and dessert wines, suggested wine and food pairings, and a wine glossary. It's available for purchase for $2.99 at ShopCrackBerry.com. For iPhone and iPod Touch owners, Hello Vino features recommendations for the wine novice as well as a question-and-answer option to narrow down the choices. There's also a searchable database of nearly one million wines. More information about Hello Vino is available on the Web site. It's available for free download from iTunes.
