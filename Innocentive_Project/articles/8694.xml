  <text>HRL Laboratories L.L.C., Malibu, California, is being awarded a $10,618,875 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development to develop and demonstrate an energy-efficient, low-cost mixed-signal chip set for separating and analyzing mixtures of complex wideband radio frequency signals, and also to develop an integrated radio frequency front-end that will integrate with the chip set and demonstrate signal separation and classification with low power consumption. U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
