Work will be performed in Melbourne and is expected to be completed by March 2019. Fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy); fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy); and fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funding in the amount of $17,012,675 will be obligated at the time of award.Â Funds in the amount of $1,704,964 will expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
