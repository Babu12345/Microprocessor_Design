  <text>Lockheed Martin Corp., Missile and Fire Control, Orlando, Florida, is being awarded a $150,957,577 firm-fixed-price definitive contract for the Target Sight System (TSS) on the AH-1Z Cobra attack helicopter. The TSS is a large-aperture midwave forward-looking infrared sensor with a laser designator/rangefinder turret. The TSS provides the capability to identify and laser-designate targets at maximum weapon range, significantly enhancing platform survivability and lethality. The anticipated contract will support the AH-1Z Cobra helicopter production efforts of PMA-276 and the government of Pakistan. This contract includes options that, if exercised, would bring its cumulative value to $284,600,293. This contract combines purchases for the Navy (88 percent) and the government of Pakistan (12 percent) under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Work will be performed in Orlando (83 percent) and in Ocala, Florida (17 percent), and is expected to be complete by January 2022. Fiscal 2017 and 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy); fiscal 2016 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy); and FMS and funding in the amount of $150,957,577 will be obligated at the time of contract award, and $3,019,151 will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The contract was not competitively procured in accordance with 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1); only one responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity (N00164-17-C-JQ71).</text>
