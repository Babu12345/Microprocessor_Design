  <text>Defense Department personnel are encouraged to update their information for the new DOD Enterprise White Pages, which provides browser-based access to DOD enterprise identity and contact information maintained by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Person Data Repository.
	The tool, which can be accessed by users with a valid Common Access Card or External Certification Authority certificate via the Internet or the Unclassified-But-Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network, is part of the Defense Information Systems Agency’s Identity and Access Management collection of solutions.
	DOD personnel can update their duty organization, duty location and other attribute information managed by the DMDC at http://milconnect.dmdc.mil.
	The DOD Enterprise White Pages replaces the Joint Enterprise Directory Services search.
