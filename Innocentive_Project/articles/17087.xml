IUSS provides the Navy with submarine detection, identification and classification. Work will be performed in Manassas, Virginia (95 percent); and Clearwater, Florida (5 percent), and is expected to be completed by December 2017. Fiscal 2015 and 2016 shipbuilding conversion (Navy); fiscal 2016 and 2017 other procurement (Navy); and fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funding in the amount of $12,580,386 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year.
