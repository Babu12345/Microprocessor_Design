  <text>NCI Inc., Reston, Va., has announced that it was awarded a cost-plus-fixed-fee, single-award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract valued at $125 million for cyber network operations and security support (CNOSS) services for the U.S. Army's Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) G3/5/7. NCI has served NETCOM since 2007, with two predecessor contracts to CNOSS. The new contract has a 12-month base period with two one-year option periods and one six-month option period. NETCOM has primary oversight of network operations and security for the U.S. Army and serves as the single point of contact for network development and protection. NETCOM ensures information technology services, systems and networks are secure, responsive and available to its global U.S. Army users in all operational environments.
