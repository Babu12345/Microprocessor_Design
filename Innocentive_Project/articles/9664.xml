  <text>Through its America the Beautiful program, the National Park Service is offering free passes to military members and their dependents. The passes grant no-cost admission to federal recreation sites. Depending on how admission is charged at various facilities, the benefit allows pass owners and accompanying passengers in a single, noncommerical vehicle to enter the sites for free or for the pass owner and three persons age 16 and older to enter without paying a fee. No entry fee is charged for children under 15.

Eligible troops can claim their passes by presenting their military identifications at most federal lands that charge entrance fees. A list of sites by state that sell passes is available as well.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families,Â please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
