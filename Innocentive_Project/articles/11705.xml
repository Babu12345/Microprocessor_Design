  <text>In the military community, moving is often a part of life, and that includes buying and selling items along the way. The free Call Dibs app makes that process easier by providing a convenient space for active duty, Reserve, Guard, veterans, U.S. Defense Department civilians and their families to offload or find goods.
	An alternative to sites like Craigslist, Call Dibs focuses exclusively on the military community to add a layer of trust and a sense of security to the process.
	Use the app to post items quickly from your phone, browse listings by others, and send and receive messages. You must have a .mil email address to be validated as a military user.
	Download the app from the iTunes App Store or participate through the Call Dibs website.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new Web sites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
