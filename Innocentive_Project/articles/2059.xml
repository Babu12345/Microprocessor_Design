  <text>It’s that time of the year again—back to school, fall, football and the AFCEA membership survey! All AFCEA members will receive an e-mail in October with a link to your opportunity to provide valuable input on the organization. Questions will focus on member satisfaction, programs and services, member benefits, and AFCEA events. Your responses will help the association tailor membership benefits, programs and services to meet members’ needs. The information you provide is critical to AFCEA’s budget and planning processes.  AFCEA was pleased with the results of its second annual membership survey, conducted last fall. Three-quarters of members reported overall satisfaction with AFCEA. Nine out of 10 members were likely to renew membership and to recommend AFCEA to friends and business associates.  Based on the feedback received, AFCEA established 11 categories of “action items” and made these changes:Created a “best practices” sharing tool for chapters Expanded online PDC course offerings Improved member engagement and involvement Increased communication of Web 2.0 technologies, including blogs, wikis, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Second Life, GovLoop and webinars Reviewed events and consolidated headquarters events where possibleAs AFCEA strives to improve service to members, the association will continue to work on the action items and looks forward to revising its plan to incorporate this year’s survey results.  Market Connections Incorporated, a full-service market research firm that specializes in public sector and association research in the defense and information technology markets, will conduct the survey.  To ensure participation in this feedback opportunity, please review your membership records through the AFCEA portal and make sure association records reflect your current information, especially an accurate e-mail address. In addition, it is important to adjust your e-mail spam filters to allow e-mails from afceasurvey@marketconnectionsinc.com. Market Connections will only use member e-mail addresses to invite AFCEANs to participate in the survey. All responses will be anonymous and only reported in aggregate. Questions about the survey can be sent to service@afcea.org. Thank you in advance for participating in the member survey!</text>
