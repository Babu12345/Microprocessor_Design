  <text>Warfighters, welcome back! ReBoot Camp is the 1st Civilian Division-an organization that links up veterans so they can support each other to make successful transitions from the military to civilian life. The program helps reconnect veterans with family, friends, community and careers. ReBoot Camp wants warriors to understand that adjusting to life after combat is difficult, but no one has to do it alone. Currently, there are weekly meetings in Livermore, California, and job readiness workshops in Dublin, California, but the organization is working to expand its efforts to other geographic locations. The program also is developing mentorships and starting a writers group. Anyone interested in those activities is encouraged to reach out to the organization to become involved. Contact information is available online. ReBoot Camp is in its early stages of development and is striving to put into place the community, career and work resources that veterans need. Program officials would like veterans to provide their information and opinions about what will help them most. Businesses and other organizations also can offer input about their services and how they can help troops acclimate to being civilians again. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
