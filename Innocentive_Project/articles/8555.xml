  <text>Know before you go: this free iPhone app from the U.S. State Department gives travelers easy access to official country information across the globe. Access travel alerts and warnings, maps, embassy locations and more in the click of a button. The Smart Traveler app allows you to create personal itineraries, add notes and organize your trips. It makes safety priority one for people headed overseas by including alerts and warnings; safety and security procedures; information on recent crimes; crime penalties; and entry and exit requirements. The app also provides access to the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), which helps the department assist you during natural disasters, unrest in foreign countries and lost/stolen passports overseas. You also can contact the department instantly through links to Facebook and Twitter. Just for fun, give your iPhone a shake and land on a random country. Download the app for free from the iTunes App Store. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
