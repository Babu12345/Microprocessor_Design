  <text>Trex Enterprises Corp., San Diego, Calif., has been awarded a $23,550,321 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for military imaging surveillance technology-long range (MIST-LR) technical area 1. The objective of this program is to research and advance computational imaging techniques in support of beyond-the-diffraction-limit imaging. These techniques will provide high-resolution imagery from available apertures and thus will support target identification missions at extended ranges supporting operations in denied environments. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-13-C-7371).</text>
