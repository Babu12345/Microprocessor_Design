  <text>It is time for the services to get rid of their network operation and support centers, or NOSCs, according to a high-ranking Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) official. Maj. Gen. Ronnie D. Hawkins Jr., USAF, vice director, DISA, called for the end of service NOSCs as part of DISA's effort to eliminate stovepipes. "We must get rid of service NOSCs; they are hindering our capability," Gen. Hawkins said in his Wednesday morning breakfast address at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2010 in Honolulu, Hawaii. He added that he believes that any combatant command J-6 will say the same thing. Gen. Hawkins also called for the elimination of the term "network centric," saying it was obsolete. Network centric refers to ownership, but cyberspace has no owner. Instead, the military should adopt the term "cyber centric" as it continues to exploit information technologies.</text>
