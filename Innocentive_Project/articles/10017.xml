  <text>The U.S. Defense Department is creating a department-wide system to track and manage human subjects in studies funded by the federal government. A Web-based application developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), called the Protections in Research, Oversight Management Information System (PROMIS), will form the basis for the new system. PROMIS enables researchers to submit human research protocols and other documention for review by U.S. Marine Corps and Navy compliance specialists. Since the decision to create a larger tracking system, the ONR personnel have been creating enhancements to PROMIS so it can function as a unified platform to serve needs across the U.S. military's user community.</text>
