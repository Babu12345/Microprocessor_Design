  <text>Military members transitioning to the civilian workplace have a new resource for their job searches courtesy of the U.S. Defense Department. The Career Decision Toolkit walks users through various phases of the employment hunt including: career exploration, financial planning, search success, effective résumÃ©s and cover letters, interviewing, and negotiating compensation. The various modules can be accessed in any order and at any time. Though available online to everyone, the resource especially is intended to assist troops who are prohibited geographically from attending Transition Assistance Program classes.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
