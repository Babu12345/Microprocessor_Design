  <text>The Co-occurring Conditions Toolkit app for Android and iPhone serves as a quick reference for primary care providers working with patients experiencing a mild traumatic brain injury along with other co-occurring conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, chronic pain and substance abuse. Developed by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology (T2), the mobile app includes clinical practice guidelines and recommendations from the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. It gives health care professionals immediate access to critical information, which ultimately improves the quality of care for service members and veterans. The program includes treatment recommendations, enhanced provider-patient interactions and specialty referrals. The app is free and available for download from the iTunes App Store and the Android Market. For information on all the mobiles apps available from the T2, visit www.t2health.org/mobile-apps.
