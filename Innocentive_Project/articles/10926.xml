Comtech EF Data, Tempe, Ariz., is being awarded a potential $28,350,859 cost-plus-incentive-fee, cost-plus-fixed-fee, firm-fixed-price contract for development and production of Advanced Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Interface Processor (ATIP). The ATIP will replace the legacy TDMA Interface Processor. The ATIP is a Layer-2 Ethernet bridging device that will be installed on ship, shore and submarine platforms. It provides transparent bridging capability among Internet protocol users that are geographically dispersed and connected via Milstar Medium Data Rate (MDR), Advanced Extremely High Frequency MDR/Extended Data Rate (XDR) or Enhanced Polar XDR links. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, Calif., is the contracting activity.</text>
