  <text>Smartphones can now communicate on 90 percent of the Earth not covered by traditional wireless networks. The Iridium AxcessPoint Mail and Web App provides email and Internet connections and features a built-in firewall to block extraneous Internet traffic. Data speeds are up to five times faster for Web browsing and 15 times faster for email. In September 2011, Iridium Communications Incorporated launched its AxcessPoint Wi-Fi hotspot accessory, a portable modem that connects devices to Iridium using an Iridium Extreme or Iridium 9555 satellite phone. Users must own either of these and a purchase a subscription to use the free AxcessPoint Mail and Web App, which is available at the iTunes App Store.
