  <text>Infoscitex Corp., Waltham, Mass. (FA8650-14-D-6500) and Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp., Systems Engineering Solutions, Boulder, Colo. (FA8650-14-D-6501), have each been awarded a $60,100,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for research and development. The goal of these contracts is to provide the 711th Human Performance Wing (HPW)/RHC with research to perform the mission of “increase warfighter lethality and enhance combat survivability while reducing information processing demands through revolutionary human interface technology.” The 711th HPW/RHC is transforming its portfolio to emphasize the technology priorities of: control of remotely piloted aircraft; decision making and autonomy; multi-sensory technologies; conceptual design and demonstration of advanced information operations workstations; advanced visualizations, technology and human cognitive modeling. These technologies will be used to transform the following concepts of operations objectives: battlespace visualization, planning and assessment tools; find, fix, track, target, engage and assess and seamless decision support. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
