Lockheed Martin will continue to provide enhanced communications reliability, survivability, information capabilities, and user support within the National Capital Region on behalf of the Air Force District of Washington under a new, approximately $320 million contract, the company has announced. Under the one-year base, nine-options award, Lockheed Martin will run the Network Command Center, supporting the Air Force’s National Capital Region IT communications network used by all Air Force personnel in the Washington, DC region—including the Pentagon, Joint Base Andrews, and Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. Services will include desktop support, enterprise applications, plans, projects and engineering services, and National Military Command Center support. In addition to the site consolidations, Lockheed Martin also created the Shared Computing Environment, a migration of enterprise platforms across a unified infrastructure of storage, computers, networks, and virtualization environment, establishing a virtual computing space.  </text>
