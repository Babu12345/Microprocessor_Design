  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation Electronic Systems is being awarded a contract modification valued at $40.5 million. This contract modification is to establish an estimated cost ceiling for the Ground/Air Task-Oriented Radar (G/ATOR) System Development and Demonstration to reflect the anticipated cost overrun associated with the contractor's estimate to complete for an additional $36 million. </text>
