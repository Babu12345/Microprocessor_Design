  <text>Woo Woo! All aboard! And first in line! Amtrak offers a 10 percent military discount to active-duty troops and their dependents on the lowest available fare on most trains. Troops in uniform also are welcome to jump to the head of the ticket line.
	The rail service also has Veterans Advantage card program for veterans, active duty military personnel, members of the National Guard and Reserve and next of kin family members. The program requires a paid membership and includes discount on Amtrak and with other vendors. If you take advantage of the free 30-day trial period, be aware you must opt out of the program at the end or you will be billed from then on.
	With air traffic controllers on furloughs and security lines getting ever longer, now might be the perfect time to try a trip by train.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNALâ€™s senior news editor.</text>
