  <text>Giving gifts just got a whole lot easier. The Karma app for iPhone and Android helps you track meaningful events and instantly send personalized gifts to friends and family. Most people would probably admit to forgetting a birthday or graduation and scrambling to send a card or present at the last minute. But the Karma app connects with Facebook to notify you of any important dates coming up via text message, email or Facebook. Then, you simply select a gift from within the app, pick a card and hit send. No shipping address is needed to deliver the presents. The recipient fills in the information once they receive notification of the gift, and Karma takes care of shipping it out. You won't be billed until the present is sent. In addition, gift recipients can personalize the gift with their choice of color, style, flavor, etc. They even have the option to swap the selected item for something else or donate the value to charity. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
