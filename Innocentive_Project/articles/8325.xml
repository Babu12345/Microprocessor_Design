  <text>Get all your medical information on the go with the free mPHR app for iPhone. Developed by CTSI Incorporated, the program gives you instant access to mobile personal health records, including test results, medical history, medications, allergies and immunizations. In addition to viewing records, the app allows you to program reminders and directions for your next appointment, refill a prescription, set alerts for medication and update your doctors and other health care professionals instantly. You can also use the medication manager to avoid duplicate prescriptions and adverse reactions to multiple pills. The app is secure and syncs with Google health, Google calendar, MobileMe, Microsoft Outlook, major pharmacies and hospital systems. Download it for free from the iTunes App Store.
