From a print advertisement to an online purchase in one click, a new iOS app lets you pounce on products from your favorite brands. The free Pounce app uses image recognition to let users scan an item from newspapers or magazines. It securely stores shipping and billing information to automate the buying process. Just scan a product and click "Buy Now." The processing, packing and shipping are done directly from the retailer just like with a regular online purchase.
	The app will recognize products from any retail partners, which currently include Target, Staples, Toys "R" Us and Ace Hardware, among others.
	According to the app's FAQ page, developers are "working hard to make Pounce available for Android users soon."
	Download the app from the iTunes App Store.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new Web sites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
