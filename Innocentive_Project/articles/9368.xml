  <text>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) Diverse Accessible Heterogeneous Integration program is initiating a foundry technology effort to find innovative methods to combine a variety of devices and materials onto a single silicon chip. When achieved, the capability will provide the U.S. Defense Department with single-chip capabilities integration options without performance limitations. According to Dr. Sanjay Raman, DARPA program manager, the agency plans to bring the compound semiconductor and silicon integrated circuit communities together in new ways. Organizations interested in learning more about the project can attend the proposers' day on April 18 at the DARPA offices.</text>
