  <text>General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Fairfax, Virginia, is being awarded a nearly $27 million contract modification for the production of the Navy's Common Display System (CDS), a commercial, off-the-shelf-based, grade A shock-qualified, display system in support of various Navy platforms. The CDS equipment procurement provides a family of display systems that support the Navy's implementation of open architecture for Navy combat systems. The CDS is designed around commercially available hardware and software and will provide computer displays to support combat systems on various Navy ships, submarines, and aircraft, with potential for U.S. Marine Corps and allied use. The CDS will meet the computer display requirements of other programs of record, including Aegis modernization. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
