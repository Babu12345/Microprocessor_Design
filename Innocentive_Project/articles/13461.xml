  <text>KEYW Corp., Hanover, Maryland, has been awarded a $38 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for research and development. Contractor will assist the Layer Sensor Exploitation Division at the Air Force Research Laboratory in developing new command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems to exploit existing sensors of all kinds. Some examples of exploitation include target recognition, tracking, fusion, sensor management (autonomy) and registration. Exploitation research is shifting from permissive to contested environments. This shift drives a corresponding need in test strategies to match. Analysis, test and integration of sensor systems is focused on developing laboratory or relevant environments to achieve technology readiness level (TRL) 6, with the desire to achieve higher TRLs through demonstrations and system tests in environments as close to operational as is feasible, affordable and practical. Work will be performed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and is expected to be completed by Sept. 12, 2021. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-14-D-1742).</text>
