  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training, Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded a $78,810,265 fixed-price incentive firm modification to previously awarded contract N00024-13-C-5225 for the Navy’s fiscal 2016 AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 surface ship Undersea Warfare System (USW) systems. The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is a surface ship USW combat system with the capabilities to search, detect, classify, localize and track undersea contacts; and to engage and evade submarines, mine-like small objects and torpedo threats. The contract is for production of the Technical Insertion 14 baseline of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 USW systems for fiscal 2016. This contract involves foreign military sales (FMS) to Japan. Work will be performed in Lemont Furnace, Pennsylvania (56 percent); Syracuse, New York (23 percent); Clearwater, Florida (14 percent); and Owego, New York (7 percent), and is expected to be completed by May 2018. Fiscal 2015 and 2016 other procurement (Navy); fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy); and FMS funding in the amount of $78,810,265 will be obligated at the time of award. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The contract was competitively procured with proposals solicited via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with one offer received. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity.</text>
