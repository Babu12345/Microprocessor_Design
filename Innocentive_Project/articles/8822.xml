  <text>A new strategy for certifying commercial launch vehicles aims to expand the number of companies qualified for space launch missions. The entrant launch vehicle certification strategy is a cooperative effort between the U.S. Air Force, the National Reconnaissance Office and NASA. The three agencies outlined the joint strategy for certifying new entrants to encourage competition and provide a level playing field for all competitors. The risk-based certification framework is consistent with existing NASA policy that allows new launch providers to compete for NASA non-crewed missions in all vehicle classes. Although one common strategy exists, each agency can determine its own mission-unique requirements.</text>
