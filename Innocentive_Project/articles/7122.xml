  <text>The U.S. Navy Memorial in Washington, D.C., is hosting a special exhibit until March 2011 that honors military explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel. The display includes an authentic bomb disposal suit and robot as well as details about the history, methods and personnel involved in this dangerous line of work. Jones International University is sponsoring the exhibit, which the school believes pays homage to EOD warfighters from all military branches who risk their lives for their country. The university offers programs tailored to military members' needs. In addition to the description and photos of the EOD exhibit on the Navy Memorial website, visitors can find more information about public and private events and the "Year of Navy Supply" exhibit, which also runs through next March.  Homefront Help has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
