  <text>Aerofex Corporation, Manhattan Beach, California, recently released video of a proof-of-concept, motorcycle-like hovercraft that requires no flight control software and is touted as being intuitive to ride. The design pushes dust, snow or debris away from the pilot to avoid the brownout or whiteout conditions helicopter pilots often face in sandy or snowy terrain. The hover bike could be used for personal entertainment, border patrol in areas without roads or in a fleet of first-responder craft. Company officials envision an unmanned version in the future. The proof of concept vehicle is being used as a testbed for manned and unmanned technologies.</text>
