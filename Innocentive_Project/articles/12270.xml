  <text>A lot of websites and apps offer weather predictions, but what if you could get a much more detailed forecast? The Dark Sky app for iPhone and iPad, which got its start as a Kickstarter project back in November 2011, predicts rain and storms down to the minute based on your exact location. While a typical weather app may warn of a "20 percent chance of rain in Washington, D.C., for the day," the Dark Sky app could send you a push notification 20 minutes before the rain literally passes over your house.
	Dark Sky uses GPS to create the "hyperlocal" forecasts and storm alerts. A new update just released for the app includes extended 24-hour and 7-day forecasts along with new global maps.
	The app also features detailed weather animations showing the path of a storm and where it's headed in the future.
	Dark Sky is available for $3.99 in the iTunes App Store.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
