  <text>Donating to many of the country’s most prominent military charities now is a little bit easier. More than 100 such organizations have come together on The United Heroes Campaign to give people a one-stop shop for giving back. Visitors to the site can choose to share a single or recurring gift with one or more of the charities listed. They can also decide to have their donations shared equally among all the charities. The groups participating cover a range of needs in the military community including wounded warriors, survivors of those killed in action and support for troops currently overseas.
	Not sure where to give? No problem. Use the See the Charities link to view a list of all the participating organizations and then click on any one of them to read a description.
Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s senior news editor.</text>
