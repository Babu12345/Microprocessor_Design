  <text>A new app released on Monday gives visitors a virtual tour of Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) along with information on burials, wreath-laying ceremonies and other events. To create the ANC Explorer app, the U.S. Army photographed more than 250,000 grave sites and markers. The app links geospatial mapping technology to digital records and the tombstone photos. It also features locations for restrooms, water fountains and shuttle stops, and it has self-guided tours.
	In addition to assisting visitors, the program allows ANC staff to assign, manage and de-conflict events, which is a big leap from the paper-and-pen system used to track burial locations just two years ago.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play, or visit the official website of Arlington National Cemetery.
