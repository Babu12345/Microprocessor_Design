  <text>A new app from the U.S. Air Force Recruiting Service challenges users to see if they have what it takes to design the next generation of military aircraft. The Make It Fly app for the iPhone hit the Apple store in November and already has positive reviews. The free program lets you build and fly your own aircraft-from fighter jets to remotely piloted bombers. The program includes a series of nine mission objectives, and users choose from different wings, engines, weapons and fuselages to create the best plane. Pick the correct parts and fly on to the next mission. The Air Force hopes the app enhances recruiting efforts by sparking an interest science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store.  These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
