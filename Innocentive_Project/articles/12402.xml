  <text>Sierra Nevada Corp., Sparks, Nev. (M67854-14-D-2521) and Northrop Grumman Corp., Herndon, Va. (M67854-14-D-2522) are each being awarded a firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity multiple award contract for the counter radio-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) electronic warfare Marine Expeditionary Unit Special Operation capable (CREW MEU (SOC), dismounted systems. The CREW MEU (SOC) program addresses an urgent and compelling need for a capability to counter the threat posed by IEDs. The maximum ceiling for both contracts is $90,000,000, with the two contractors having an opportunity to compete for individual orders under the terms and conditions of the awarded contracts throughout the 60-month ordering period of the contracts. The contractors will deliver five initial production systems each for testing under the first delivery orders and the remaining 360 production systems and contract requirements will be competed for each subsequent delivery order. Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Va., is the contracting activity.</text>
