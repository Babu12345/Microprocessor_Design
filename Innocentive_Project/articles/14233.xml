  <text>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) has announced its first business accelerator program, EMERGE!, aimed at entrepreneurs who have innovative ideas that address the unique needs of the homeland security community and whose wearable technologies could be adapted for first responder operations.

Program officials seek innovative solutions to help future first responders save lives and carry out their missions, particularly in the area of wearable technologies, such as body-worn electronics, advanced sensors, and integrated voice and data communications embedded in a responder’s gear. The EMERGE! program will help innovators develop and launch their ideas into investable companies by providing early market validation, mentoring and access to private investment. The program will accelerate the development of selected commercial wearable technologies and provide a path to introduce those technologies to a variety of markets, including government sector partners.

The program was developed in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Academy, DHS Center for Innovation and the Center for Innovative Technology.
