  <text>The three-day Horses for Veterans workshops help former troops cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, commonly referred to as PTSD, through interactions with horses. By establishing trusting relationships with the equines without a need to use force, veterans can gain skills for improving and moving forward with their lives. The free workshops take place periodically at Flag is Up Farms in Solvang, California. A video showing actual footage from a workshop last year demonstrates the types of activities participants will experience.

The next event is scheduled for May 18-20 and spots are still available. E-mail Maya Horsey at Maya@Join-Up.org to register. Future workshop dates are being finalized for
later in the year, so prepare to saddle up!

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
