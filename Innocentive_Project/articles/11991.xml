  <text>You don't have to be tied to a desk to prepare for an upcoming presentation. The Keynote app for iPad and iPhone makes it easy to create a slide deck complete with animation, charts, images and more.
	Simply pick from one of 30 themes, add your information and present right on your mobile device. You also can use video mirroring to present on an HDTV while viewing the Presenter Display on your phone or tablet. Presentations are accessible across devices through iCloud.
	The app lets you select slide layouts, animations, fonts and style options; create interactive charts; import and edit Microsoft PowerPoint files; and get help with Coaching Tips.
	It's easy to share your finished product with a link via email, messages and social media.
	You can purchase the app for $9.99 from the iTunes App Store. Would you pay that much for an app if it increased your productivity at work?These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
