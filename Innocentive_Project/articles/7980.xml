  <text>Try before you buy. The new Amazon Appstore gives Android users a chance to test drive apps in a browser window before deciding to pay or download. Launched last week, the Amazon Appstore provides an alternative to Google's open Android Market, which accepts any apps without a formal review. Amazon will examine and evaluate all the programs before making them available and will also control and adjust pricing. One of the most buzzed about features of the new store is the option to Test Drive apps. When you click the "Test drive now" button, a copy of the app will be available in a simulated phone within the browser. You can then explore the app for 30 minutes as if it were running on your smart phone. In addition to previewing apps, you can also look at bestsellers and top rated apps, view new releases, download daily freebies and find deals on programs. Developers who want their apps in the Amazon store can join the Amazon Appstore Developer Program for $99 and submit an app for review. If you sign up now, Amazon will waive the fee for the first year.
