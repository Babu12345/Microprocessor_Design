Receives JITC Certification for the 2110 HF Manpack Codan (ASX-CDA) today announced that it has received certification from the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) for the Codan 2110 high frequency (HF) manpack transceiver. According to the notification, the Codan 2110 manpack is certified as conforming to the Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) requirements of Military Standard (MIL-STD)-188-141B, Interoperability and Performance Standards for Medium and HF Radio Equipment.The JITC certification enables interoperability between Codan and other HF radio brands and establishes a common waveform for ALE operation.  This is important in coalition and Partnership for Peace (PFP) operations and the extension of HF networks for emergency preparedness and disaster relief.“JITC certification is a major differentiator for Codan HF radios and we are pleased to support the MIL-STD-188-141B in both our NGT and 2110-based systems,” said Andrew W. Sheppard, vice president and general manager, Codan US Inc.  “Codan is committed to supporting the need for critical interoperability between coalition and Partnership-for-Peace (PfP) countries and expansion of these requirements within Central Asia, the Middle East and developing world countries.” Within minutes of a radio operator initiating a call, ALE chooses the best frequency and signals the operators on both ends so they can begin communicating with each other immediately. One of the many benefits of ALE is that it eliminates the need for repetitive calling on pre-determined time schedules and monitoring static on HF radios.About CodanThe Codan US Inc. Military and Security Division focuses on providing affordable, reliable HF radio communications products and systems for worldwide defense and government organizations. Codan has supplied more than 100,000 radios to over 150 countries, including the US Department of Defense, Department of State, and civil authority segments within internal security. Currently, Codan is providing thousands of transceivers to support security and rebuilding programs worldwide.

SHIELD-FLEX™ is designed to protect sensitive electronic circuits from electromagnetic and radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) in such markets as medical, military, industrial, government and/or defense, commercial, telecommunications, aerospace, public transport and utilities. Applications for shielded flexible conduit include: communications, medical diagnostics equipment, ship building, solar/wind energy, radio broadband/antenna, Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), data centers, test &amp; measurement equipment, air handling equipment (HVAC), CE – European Standard, and radar and data transmission. These products accept industry standard liquid-tight connectors and address the problems of assembly and grounding. All versions can be manufactured with halogen-free jacketing material, using a HF prefix.Good Shielding: Type SLA™, UL Listed, is a flexible steel conduit with a galvanized steel core, over which a tinned copper shielding braid is applied. The outer jacket is flexible PVC with a temperature rating of -20° to 60° C while the braid offers a minimum of 90% shielding coverage. Better Shielding: Type EMS™ offers a better shielding effectiveness than Type SLA with a temperature rating of -55° C to 105° C. EMS features a flexible core constructed of a helically wound, fully interlocked strip of bronze. An all-temperature PVC jacket is extruded over the core, resulting in a sealed, waterproof raceway when assembled with liquid-tight fittings. BEST Shielding: Type EMCS™ is a hybrid of SLA and EMS because it utilizes the same bronze core and PVC jacket as EMS but gets further screening protection from a tinned copper braid as found in the SLA product. Type EMCS offers the same working temperatures as EMS.To receive more information on Electri-Flex’ line of Shielding Conduits, please visit http://www.electriflex.com/shield-flex.htm, or email Marketing at mktg@electriflex.com.
