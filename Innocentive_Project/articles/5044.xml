  <text>The Republic of Singapore Air Force is acquiring sniper advanced targeting pods (ATPs) for the country's F-16 Block 52 aircraft. As part of the purchase agreement, the nation will receive integration, spares, support equipment and integrated logistics support to expand the Air Force's fleet of sniper ATPs across its F-15 and F-16 aircraft. The pods will integrate onto the F-16 Block 52s and will not inhibit operations. The sniper ATPs enable aircrews to conduct missions while outside of the range of many enemy threats. The pods currently fly on several multinational aircraft and are used in operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Deliveries will begin in 2010. Lockheed Martin Corporation received the direct commercial sale contact from the Republic of Singapore Air Force, but contract funding details were not released.
