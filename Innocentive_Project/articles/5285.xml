  <text>Navistar International Corporation's Navistar Defense LLC has received a U.S. Marine Corps contract worth more than $752 million to produce a lighter, smaller and more mobile version of its International MaxxPro mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) family of vehicles. The MaxxPro Dash maintains the survivability system used on all MaxxPro MRAP variants while allowing for greater mobility in smaller, lightweight vehicles ideal for Afghanistan operations.</text>
