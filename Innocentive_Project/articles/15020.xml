  <text>Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Washington, was awarded an increased ceiling modification to the established firm-fixed-price, single award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for Microsoft enterprise technical support services, necessary to obtain highly trained Microsoft Blue Badge Cardholder support. These services require access rights to Microsoft's proprietary (closed-source) code, which is licensed under exclusive legal right of Microsoft, and are required to support the Department of Defense's mission. The total cumulative of the contract was increased by $162,760,000 from $412,240,000 to $575,000,000.

The period of performance remains as a one-year base period and four one-year option periods for a total period of five years. Performance will predominantly be within the continental U.S.; however, support services may also be required at multiple locations outside the continental U.S. A proposal was solicited via electronic means to Microsoft and received. The notice of intent was posted on Aug. 6, 2015, on the Federal Business Opportunity portal. The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is the contracting activity (HC1028-13-D-0013-P00008). (Awarded Aug. 27, 2015)
