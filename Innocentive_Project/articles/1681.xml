  <text>Many government agencies are moving to an everything over Internet protocol (EoIP) environment to reduce costs and improve efficiencies. While the benefits of these initiatives can be substantial, transitioning to a converged EoIP infrastructure can be challenging, particularly for large organizations.An EoIP environment not only ensures consistent accessibility to services and applications but also enables the quick deployment and scaling of both legacy and new services and applications, tailoring them to current missions. Experts agree that this architecture offers advantages, but they advise that it is not as easy as flipping a switch.Among some of the issues that organizations’ chief technology officers should consider before moving to EoIP are how to provide services in an era of national security intelligence and e-government; how to preserve investments in existing systems; and how to deliver global network services. These and other topics will be discussed during the next free SIGNAL Magazine Webinar on August 21 at 2 p.m. EDT.Henry Kenyon, business editor, SIGNAL Magazine, will moderate the discussion. Scheduled to contribute to the conversation are Jim Kelly, senior product line manager, circuit-to-packet products, Juniper Networks, and Tom Grady, principal engineer, CACI Federal. These experts in the field will talk about the lessons that have been learned about the impact that moving to EoIP can have on circuit applications. Webinar attendees are encouraged to use the text messaging system available on the webinar site to ask questions and contribute insights. </text>
