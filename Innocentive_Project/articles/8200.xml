  <text>Make the most of your layover with the free GateGuru app for frequent travelers. Forget endlessly searching through airports for a good cup of coffee or a clean restroom-the GateGuru app for iPhone and iPad makes it all manageable. Developed by Mobility Apps LLC, the app contains searchable directories for more than 120 airports in the United States and abroad. It can help you find an ATM, a coffee shop and the best place to eat when you're stuck between flights. The app allows you to view travel itineraries; view and post security wait times; and see a list of airport food, shops and services. Select locations include more than 20,000 reviews, tips and pictures from fellow travelers. In addition, you can tap into airport maps, sort amenities by ratings and location, bookmark your favorite options and share your posts through Facebook and Twitter. Download the free app in the iTunes App Store. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
