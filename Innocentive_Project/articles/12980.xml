  <text>Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services (HPES), Herndon, Virginia, is being awarded a $138 million modification to a previously awarded contract (N00039-10-D-0010) for the continuity of services contract (CoSC) for Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI). The modification includes increasing the contract ceiling from $5,603,792,250 to $5,741,792,250, and adding an option to extend the period of performance by three months, from July 1, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2014. The NMCI services are currently provided under the CoSC, which was awarded to HPES in order to continue providing information technology (IT) services following the expiration of the original NMCI contract. The CoSC ensures that the scope of NMCI IT services and performance levels delivered are sustained until the Next Generation Enterprise Network contract is satisfactorily providing the replacement services. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, California, is the contracting activity.</text>
