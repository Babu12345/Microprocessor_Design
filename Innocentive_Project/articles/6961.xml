  <text>The USO in conjunction with the Trevor Romain Foundation has released a free, animated movie titled "With You All the Way! Dealing With Deployment." The DVD addresses preparing for deployment, staying connected during the separation and planning for reunion. The movie also helps civilian children understand the challenges their friends in the military community face when a loved one is deployed. In addition to the DVD, military families can receive deployment kits at no charge. These contain postcards to send to those deployed, an interactive journal with activities and writing prompts, a caregiver booklet, a keepsake box, a set of dog tags and a stuffed bear. Families who want copies of the movie and kits can visit a USO center and pick them up, or request them through Military OneSource.</text>
