Mutualink’s Tactical Collaboration Nodes will enable seamless voice interoperability with other radio and communications systems, and sharing of streaming video, text and files among responders both within a tactical deployment area and with other partner agencies and personnel on a wide-area to nationwide basis via the New Jersey Interoperable Response and Preparedness Platform network. Mutualink's technology will be installed in multiple JerseyNet System on Wheels (SOWs) and will also be deployed within tactical portable cases that tether to the SOWs and can also connect to other networks.</text>
