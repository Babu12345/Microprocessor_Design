  <text>Federal spending on cybersecurity is expected to grow dynamically over the next five years. According to Kathleen Miller, director of procurement and logistics, DISA, chief, Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, this spending will increase from $7.9 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $11.7 billion in fiscal year 2014. This constitutes a compound annual rate of 8.1 percent, and she pointed out that this growth rate is more than twice that of federal information technology spending.
