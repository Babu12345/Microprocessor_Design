  <text>Grocery store reward cards ... gym membership cards ... store loyalty cards. With so many different reward programs, it's not long before you can barely find your keys among all the little plastic cards hanging from the ring. Add in gift cards and stacks of coupons, and your wallet is bursting at the seams. The Key Ring app keeps everything in one virtual place. Simply scan the barcodes on your loyalty cards to add them to your phone, and then scan straight from your phone at the checkout counter.
	You can use the app to share cards with family members; download and use free digital coupons from more than 13,000 brands and retailers; share deals and offers through social media and email; locate stores and find contact information; and create shopping lists to share.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
