  <text>I'm a fan of all things Discovery: Animal Planet, TLC, and of course the Science and Military channels. So I'm particularly excited about the Discovery News iPhone application. Fans like me can get instant access to the most recent news articles, videos, special features and more, ensuring they'll always have the latest science and tech information at their fingertips. Features include a "Top News" section, access to more than 300 stories and videos throughout the month, and a search function that lets users browse for specific results within eight topics, including "Earth," "Space" and "Tech." The app is available for iPhones and iPod Touch and costs $0.99. For more information, visit the iTunes store.
