  <text>Life is messy-keep things simple with the Clear app for iPhone. The program lets you create any to-do list you can dream up, from your grocery items to upcoming projects at work. The app's claim to fame is its clean, intuitive interface that helps people simplify without adding more clutter or unnecessary features. It uses swipe, pull and pinch gestures in place of typical button-style navigation, and lists created in the app are color coded based on the most time-sensitive or important tasks. You can purchase the app from the iTunes App Store for $2.99.
