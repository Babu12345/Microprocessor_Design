Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. Information Systems, Network Communication Systems, San Diego, Calif., is being awarded a $20,578,917 modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract to exercise an option for ancillary equipment, hardware, and software changes to integrate the Multi-Role Tactical Common Data Link (MR-TCDL) into the E6-B aircraft. The MR-TCDL includes two Ku line-of-sight channels and one Ka satellite communications channel. Ancillary equipment includes power conditioning, cooling, electrical and network distribution, and any other integration hardware required to interface Block II B kits into the existing E6-B architecture. Ancillary software changes are those changes to existing software necessary to accommodate the new data flows and data interfaces. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Md., is the contracting activity. </text>
