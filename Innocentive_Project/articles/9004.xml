  <text>Operation Homefront is accepting nominations for the Military Child of the Year Award through January 15. Ideal candidates demonstrate resilience, strength of character and the ability to thrive in the face of the challenges of military life. They also should demonstrate leadership within their families and communities.

A child from each U.S. service branch-Marine Corps, Air Force, Army, Coast Guard and Navy-will receive the honor, which includes a $5,000 prize and a trip to Washington, D.C., for a special recognition ceremony on April 5. More information, including terms and conditions, and the nomination form are available online.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their familiesÂ please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
