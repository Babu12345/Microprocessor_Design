  <text>The American Hero Project is elegant in its simplicity and powerful in its impact. Each week, the organization uses its website and Facebook page to tell the story of a U.S. service member killed in the line of duty. A photo of each hero is included so visitors can see the faces of those people who gave their lives for a cause beyond themselves. The effort's founders both are veterans seeking to ensure that fallen heroes receive attention and to raise awareness of veterans' causes. Anyone with a story about fallen hero or who would like to see a loved one featured on the sites can contact American Hero Project at americanheroproject@gmail.com.

The organization is working toward becoming a nonprofit organization so donations will be tax deductible. American Hero Project personnel are asking anyone who can help with that effort, especially in terms of acting as or suggesting a good nonprofit attorney who will work pro bono to help with the incorporation process, to please contact them.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
