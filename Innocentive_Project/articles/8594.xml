  <text>Lockheed Martin Corporation Missiles and Fire Control, Orlando, Florida, is being awarded a nearly $50 million firm-fixed-price contract for procurement of 18 AN/AAQ-30 target sight systems (TSS) that will be integrated into the AH-1Z Cobra attack helicopter. This integration is part of the USMC H-1 upgrade program to remanufacture legacy aircraft with state of the art designs incorporated into the existing fleet of AH-1Ws, converting them to AH-1Zs. The TSS provides target identification and tracking, passive targeting for integrated weapons, including Hellfire missiles, and a laser designation capability supporting friendly laser-guided weapons. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity.</text>
