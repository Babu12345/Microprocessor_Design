  <text>Raytheon Company has received a $232.8 million contract for the system development and demonstration phase of the global positioning system-based Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) program for shipboard applications. JPALS provides all-weather shipboard landing capability to assist the U.S. Navy with pinpoint landing accuracy on aircraft carriers. The team, led by Raytheon Network Centric Systems, includes Rockwell Collins, Northrop Grumman and SAIC. The Raytheon team's solution for JPALS improves safety, lowers the total cost of ownership during the program's life cycle and provides greater flexibility and efficiency.</text>
