  <text>Raytheon Company, Denver, Colorado, has been awarded the first competitive Public Safety Long Term Evolution (LTE) contract in the nation, as well as the first contract under the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, for recipients of the FCC 700 MHz broadband waiver. The more than $8 million contract will provide Adams County, Colorado, and the adjacent Denver community, with a 15-site LTE communications system that delivers the public safety user access to next-generation broadband capabilities such as streaming video, remote data access and information sharing. The system will be deployed over the next 21 months and will become part of the nationwide public safety LTE network that will provide broadband data services to all levels of first responders throughout the county.</text>
