  <text>From potholes that need filling to graffiti in the neighborhood, the new GORequest app for the iPhone makes it easy for users to tap into their city and report problems fast. Developed by Government Outreach, the app allows users to select an issue, snap a picture using the phone's camera and submit the problem to the local government with the click of a button. Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) built into the iPhone, the app can sense the user's location and find the correct authority to address the issue. If the GPS accuracy is not working properly, users can also type in an address. GORequest is available in a limited number of areas, but creators continue to add locations as they partner with municipalities. Local residents in these areas can report problems at any time during the day, including barking dogs, abandoned vehicles, overgrown trees and unsafe sidewalks. They can then choose if they would like to hear back from officials on the status of the report. The application is free and available through the iTunes App Store.
