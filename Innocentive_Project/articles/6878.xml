  <text>Ever have one of those moments where you wished you could have simply pulled the U.S. Constitution out of your pocket? Now you can, with the  Constitution for iPhone and iPod Touch. This app includes all of the Articles, the Bill of Rights, and all the Amendments. While it would be nice if the application allowed you to search for that specific phrase you need for whatever legal debate you're currently engaged in, the app is easy enough to use that you can easily refamiliarize yourself with all the sections of the Constitution. Definitely a must-download for the younger users in the family, as well! The company that made this app also offers the Declaration of Independence app. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
