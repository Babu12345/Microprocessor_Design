  <text>This organization focuses on supporting warfighters and their families who are impacted by combat stress and post-traumatic stress disorder. The confidential and anonymous community offers free support and mental health resources to those dealing with these challenges after serving in wartime situations. The website features a self-assessment tool, anonymous forums and various interactive groups for combat veterans, significant others and parents. An eClinic provides immediate help at all times; it can be reached at 866-781-8010 or eclinic@centerstone.org. Face-to-face counseling also is available at various locations across the country. In addition, the site offers inspiration by showcasing the stories of other members of the military community who have been scarred by battle and found ways to overcome their hardships.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
