  <text>Data Link Solutions (DLS), a joint venture between Rockwell Collins and BAE Systems, has been awarded a $37 million contract from the U.S. Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command to upgrade its Joint Tactical Information Distribution Systems (JTIDS) radio terminals. JTIDS terminals provide jam-resistant digital communication of data and voice for command and control, navigation, relative positioning and identification. DLS will incorporate cryptographic modernization and frequency remapping upgrades into fielded JTIDS Class 2 terminals. The four-year program will provide operation, maintenance and sustainment for the projected service life of the JTIDS terminals through the year 2035 by adding product improvements that will allow JTIDS platforms to continue to participate in the Link 16 network, the tactical data link network used by NATO and coalition forces that allows aircraft, ships and ground forces to share a tactical picture in near-real time.</text>
