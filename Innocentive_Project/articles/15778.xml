The total contract amount after this modification will be $107,124,950. The contract also contains five unexercised options, which if exercised would increase cumulative contract value to $122,686,352. Work will be performed worldwide and is expected to be completed by June 2016.  If all options are exercised, work will continue through November 2016. Fiscal 2016 operation and maintenance (Navy) contract funds in the amount of $9,295,409 are obligated on this award and will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center, Port Hueneme, California, is the contracting activity.</text>
