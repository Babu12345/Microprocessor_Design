  <text>California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, Calif. is being awarded a $15,150,012 modification to a cooperative agreement for the autonomous diagnostics to enable prevention and therapeutics: diagnostics on demand (ADEPT: DxOD) program. The digital slipchip platform for use in limited resource settings will be designed to provide analytic parity with the equipment typically used in reference laboratories, yet with a user experience and robustness that would permit clinical laboratory improvement amendments-waived status. To allow for a high level of medical care, the device will be readable with a cell phone, so results can be transmitted to reference laboratories or remote physicians.
