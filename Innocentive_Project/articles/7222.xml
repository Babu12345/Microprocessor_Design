  <text>Heroes on the Water serves wounded and disabled active duty, Reserve and Guard troops. The group aims to help injured warfighters recover mentally and physically through the therapeutic qualities of fishing from kayaks. Participants enjoy guided fishing trips around the country. The programs offer basic kayak fishing instruction, angling clinics and paddling classes for people in various skill ranges. Adaptive kayaks, accessories and angling equipment are made available as needed to accommodate warriors with particular needs. The kayaks, various gear, meals and transportation are provided free of charge. Volunteer staff and program coordinators consist of professional educators, counselors, licensed fishing guides, wildlife and aquatic biologists, active duty military members and experienced kayak fishermen. Heroes on the Water is seeking cash and materials to run the trips as well as licensed guides, property managers and camp supervisors who can donate use of their facilities. More information about how to make a donation and contact the organization is available online. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
