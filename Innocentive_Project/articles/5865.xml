  <text>Unisys has received a contract from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to modernize the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Assistance Network (CLEAN), the state's mission-critical law enforcement communications system. Under the 18-month contract, Unisys will upgrade the CLEAN system to allow state troopers to communicate directly with other state, local and federal law enforcement officials.</text>
