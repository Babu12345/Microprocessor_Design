  <text>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, on behalf of the Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Program Office, has awarded a $34 million dollar firm fixed price contract to ViaSat Inc., Carlsbad, Calif., for the design, development, and production of a cryptographic module for the MIDS Low Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT) Block Upgrade 2. The contract encompasses the development, prototype delivery, testing, and integration of a cryptographic module that is designed for integration into a variety of MIDS-LVT hardware variants. The award also calls for production of approximately 10,000 modules for retrofit of all MIDS-LVT hardware in service at the conclusion of the development.</text>
