  <text>Lockheed Martin Sippican Incorporated, Marion, Massachusetts, is being awarded a potential $235 million contract for the production of MK48 Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) functional item replacement (FIR) kits, engineering services hours, hardware repair support, test equipment, additional spares and production support material. The MK48 Mod 7 kit production program will supply the U.S. Navy with FIR upgrade kits consisting of a guidance and control box, broadband analog sonar receiver, preamplifier, cable assemblies, and guidance and control materials. The CBASS program will provide the MK48 ADCAP Mod 6 torpedo with a wide band sonar system, and the advanced broadband signal processing algorithms, which will allow for enhanced detection and prosecution of shallow water threat targets employing advanced countermeasures. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
