  <text>FLIR Systems Inc., North Billerica, Massachusetts, is being awarded an $8 million contract for non-warranty repairs and spares for the maritime forward looking infrared radar; high-power microscopic field; and MicroStar systems. These systems are to provide maritime crafts, ground vehicles, and unmanned aircraft with all-weather, day/night, high-resolution, stabilized, forward-looking infrared thermal imaging capability to augment existing optical and radar sensors by imaging enemy forces on land, at-sea and in the air, particularly during periods of darkness and poor visibility.Â These systems enhance the detection, recognition, identification and tracking targets. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity.</text>
