  <text>Alion Science and Technology has been awarded a task order with a value of nearly $2 million to provide technical expertise on shock and vibration testing and design for the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). Alion will conduct underwater explosion shock and vibration testing for Navy ship programs such as the DDG 1000. This includes supplying subject matter expertise in establishing, implementing, monitoring and enforcing shock and vibration requirements related to ongoing ship design and construction programs that NSWC supports. DDG 1000 is the first in a class of the U.S. Navy's multi-mission surface combatants tailored for the littoral, air and subsurface warfare.</text>
