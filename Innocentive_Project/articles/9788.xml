  <text>The Pulse News app for iPad and Android takes a visual twist on traditional RSS feeds. It provides all your content in one place with a focus on photographs to catch your eye, and it's one of the most popular news apps on the market. The app lets you select and share content you care about from thousands of top news sites, blogs and social networks. Collect your favorite stories using your Pulse account and then sync them to other apps and programs, such as Evernote and Instapaper. You can also sync content across your devices. If you like a story, simply tap to share it on Facebook or Twitter. Recently, the app also incorporated local news and daily deals. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
