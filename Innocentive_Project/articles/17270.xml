  <text>AAI Corp., doing business as Textron Systems, Hunt Valley, Maryland, is being awarded a $14,820,302 fixed-price-incentive modification to a previously awarded contract (N00024-14-C-6322) to exercise Unmanned Influence Sweep System options for mine countermeasure system requirements. This modification to the contract will provide additional units to support mine countermeasure requirements.

Work will be performed in Hunt Valley (70 percent); Slidell, Louisiana (26 percent); Hauppauge, New York (2 percent); Columbia, Maryland (1 percent); and Lemont Furnace, Pennsylvania (1 percent). It is expected to be completed by September 2018. Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funding in the amount of $14,820,302 will be obligated at the time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.
