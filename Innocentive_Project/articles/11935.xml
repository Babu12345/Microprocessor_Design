  <text>To ensure the integrity of its mission to protect the nation’s information technology infrastructure, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a review of its development process for cryptographic standards and guidelines amid reports of leaked classified documents.
	NIST’s plans for review include compiling goals and objectives, principles of operation, processes for identifying cryptographic algorithms for standardization and methods for reviewing and resolving public comments. The public will be asked to comment on the process once NIST completes its review. The institute will then make any updates to the process to ensure it meets its goals of openness and transparency and secure, trusted guidance.</text>
