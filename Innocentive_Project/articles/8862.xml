  <text>SIGNAL and AFCEA extend our admiration and gratitude to all veterans. We appreciate your sacrifice not only on November 11, but every day. We have produced a special veterans supplement publication to our November edition. The resource is full of information about programs that benefit U.S. veterans and words of praise from citizens in many walks of life.

The content can be accessed on SIGNAL's  A Salute to Veterans, Troops and Their Families site, which includes a section for people to leave their own messages of support to those who have fought for freedom.</text>
