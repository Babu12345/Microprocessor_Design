  <text>The Ultra Electronics division of Tactical Communication Systems has received a contract from the Canadian Department of National Defence to supply Band 4 AN/GRC-245A HCLOSTM software-defined high-capacity radios. The HCLOSTM radio currently is being shipped worldwide in the Band 1 and 3+ frequency ranges in both 16 megabits per second (mbps) and 34 mbps full-duplex capacity. The Band 4 addition will provide enhanced operational flexibility in the crowded frequency spectrum to support communications bandwidth needs on the current battlefield.</text>
