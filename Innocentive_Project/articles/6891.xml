  <text>EADS Defence and Security and Thales have received a contract  worth 26.1 million euros from the French defence procurement agency to produce and support two sets of deployable geographic modules (MGPs)  for the French army's 28th Geographic Group. The program will develop a deployable system  that can rapidlyÂ  produce, maintain and  distribute military geography information. The MGP modules will supply geographic data updated in the field to operational land  forces via a single cartographic access point.</text>
