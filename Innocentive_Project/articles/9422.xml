  <text>The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has selected MorphoTrust, Billerica, Massachusetts, as the prime contractor for its new Universal Enrollment Service (UES), the company recently announced. UES will transition multiple programs into a consolidated service with convenient locations for individuals requiring enrollment and registration for programs serviced by TSA. The checks include the capture of biometric (facial pictures and fingerprints) and biographic data to ensure that individuals seeking access to critical segments of the nation's transportation system, infrastructure, or sensitive materials do not pose a threat to national security. As programs such as the Transportation Worker Identity Credential (TWIC) and Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) begin transitioning into the UES program, MorphoTrust will provide applicant services via the Web, telephone, and in person at hundreds of centers, including all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. Territories.</text>
