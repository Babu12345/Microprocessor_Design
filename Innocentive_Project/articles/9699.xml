  <text>The U.S. Air Force released an app that lists every event occurring at its participating United States bases. My Military Communities, or MyMC2, for Android and iOS devices features upcoming events and services along with contact information and important "quick call" buttons selected by the installation's commander. The 375th Communications Support Squadron Web application development team at Scott Air Force Base developed the app. The one-stop shop for military personnel consolidates event listings from organizational Facebook pages associated with each base. Currently, Scott Air Force Base, McConnell Air Force Base and Travis Air Force Base use the program. If your installation isn't a part of MyMC2, the developers encourage you to contact your Public Affairs Office and tell them to join. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
