Raytheon Company, Largo, Fla., is being awarded a $7,008,900 contract modification for engineering support services in support of the Cooperative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) program. The CEC program is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC, is the contracting activity. </text>
