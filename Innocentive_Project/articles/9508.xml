  <text>Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies Lab, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, is being awarded a $17,784,829 modification to a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. Option One is being exercised to continue research under the Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare Program to develop the capability to counter adaptive wireless communication threats in tactical environments and in tactically relevant time scales. Wireless communication threats include an adversary's use of wireless radios and networks for command, control and communication, as well as for other malicious uses, such as radio control improvised explosive devices. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
