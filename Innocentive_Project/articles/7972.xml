  <text>APPTIS Incorporated (formerly, SETA Corporation), McLean, Virginia, and Science Applications International Corporation, San Diego, California, were awarded two contract modifications to the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Global Solutions (DGS) contracts. The increase to the ceiling amounts were to ensure continuous, uninterrupted services provided under the DGS contracts as the government re-competes the associated efforts. As a result of these changes, the DGS contracts lifecycle period of performance end date will be changed to March 31, 2012, and the total combined ceiling will be changed from $4.2 billion to more than $4.8 billion, an increase of $635 million dollars. The DGS contracts are open for use to all federal agencies whenever the requirement to be placed is associated with the lifecycle management of the DISN. These efforts include, but are not limited to:  program management; cost/schedule; management; financial management; systems engineering; hardware and software management; test and evaluation; manufacturing; engineering; logistics; and other services required for DISN support. Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is the contracting activity.</text>
