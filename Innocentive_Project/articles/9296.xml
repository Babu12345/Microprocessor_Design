  <text>The U.S. Air Force has selected Northrop Grumman Corporation, McLean, Virginia, for the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System (WS) modernization program with an initial award of $120 million. The contract has a potential value of $504 million over eight years, if all options are exercised. AOC WS is the command and control center for planning, executing and assessing joint air operations during a contingency or conflict. Under the contract from the Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, the team led by Northrop Grumman will modernize the AOC to enable greater battle space awareness and more effective, dynamic planning and execution. AOC WS program objectives include improving the speed of command by automating information exchange, accelerating the integration of warfighter capabilities and significantly reducing lifecycle costs. Tasking under the entire contract includes design, integration, test and delivery of a network-centric infrastructure and mission applications with fielding and sustainment at eight AOC sites.</text>
