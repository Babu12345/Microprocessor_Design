  <text>Vencore Labs, Basking Ridge, New Jersey, has been awarded an $8,338,388 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development in Leveraging the Analog Domain for Security (LADS) program. Contractor will provide multi-model analog sensing to adaptively determine what features to compute from signals emitted by a device during training and testing, extracting sub-bands of interest, de-noising the individual signals and removing interfering transmission by other devices in the vicinity. Work will be performed at Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and is expected to be complete by July 15, 2020. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with 45 offers received. Fiscal 2015 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $2,304,874 are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, right-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-16-C-7623).</text>
