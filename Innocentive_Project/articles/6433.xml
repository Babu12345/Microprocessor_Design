  <text>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has awarded Raytheon Company a $5.5 million contract to design, fabricate and test Self-HEALing mixed signal Integrated Circuits (HEALICS) technology. The effort will incorporate self-healing into a complex system-on-chip design, providing the capability for the chip to sense undesired circuit behaviors and correct them automatically.</text>
