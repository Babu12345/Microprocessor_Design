The U.S. Army has awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman, Apopka, Fla., to supply Hand Held Precision Targeting Devices (HHPTDs). The HHPTD is an advanced targeting system weighing less than 5.5 pounds and providing a greater degree of precision than previous systems. To supply the accurate information needed on the modern battlefield, the device incorporates a celestial navigation module. Devices such as the HHPTD allow forces on the ground to relay accurate targeting data to aircraft and command centers. Under the terms of the $9.2 million contract, Northrop Grumman will supply the systems over a three-year period.</text>
