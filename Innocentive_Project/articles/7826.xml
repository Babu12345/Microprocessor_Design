  <abstract>A U.S. soldier used his own savings to develop an iPhone app that can help troops track the Taliban.</abstract>
  <text>Capt. Jonathan Springer, USA, an artillery specialist on his third deployment in Afghanistan, hopes to launch the Tactical Nav app for the iPhone in the first week of February. The tool will map, plot and photograph points on a battleground and convey latitude and longitude coordinates to supporting units. The app consists of a Global Positioning System, a compass, the smart phone's camera and a mapping system to pinpoint specific locations and relay that information to other users. Capt. Springer told Global Post he believes the app can find enemy positions, log locations of IEDs and call in air support for injured soldiers, among other possibilities. The 31-year-old captain put more than $25,000 of his own funding into the project.
