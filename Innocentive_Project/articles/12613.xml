  <text>The Women Subcommittee of the AFCEA International Membership Committee organized the Women in AFCEA Appreciation Event at West 2014, honoring three women who mentored and inspired female AFCEA members. Recipients of the Women in AFCEA Award were Sue Hoffman, AFCEA regional vice president of the National Capital Region; Becky Nolan, previous executive vice president of AFCEA; and Capt. Danelle Barrett, USN, chief of staff, Navy Cyber Forces.
	The event also featured an inspiring documentary on the contributions made by the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs), first shown on PBS on Veterans Day 2013. Jill Bond, the producer and director of the film, attended, along with Margo Beh, an original WASP-in-training, accompanied by her husband Richard. We Served Too: The Story of the Womenâ€™s Airforce Service Pilots of WWII has since won the Gracie Award for Outstanding Documentary.</text>
