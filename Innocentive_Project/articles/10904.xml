  <text>Many people are familiar with Pat Tillman’s story. He left an NFL career with the Arizona Cardinals to become a U.S. Army Ranger after 9/11 and was subsequently killed in the line of duty. His family and friends started the Pat Tillman Foundation to provide scholarships for military veterans and their spouses. Eligible parties interested in becoming a Tillman Military Scholar can learn more about the criteria online. The application period for 2013 is now closed, but student veterans who want to gain information before applying next year, as well as learning what programs qualify, can start their research by visiting the site at any time.
	One of the best ways to support the organization occurs later this month at Pat’s Run on April 20 at Arizona State University. Registration is open until April 12 or until all spots are taken. Sponsorship opportunities are available by calling 480-621-4074.
	People who want to support the foundation in other ways have several options. Team Tillman includes amateur athletes who compete in marathons, half marathons, triathlons, cycling or other athletic events throughout the country to raise money and awareness for the foundation. Or people can give money through more familiar means such as planned gifts, third party fundraisers and straight donations.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s senior news editor.</text>
