  <text>Codan Radio Communications, Victoria, Canada, a division of Codan Limited (ASX-CDA), has secured a $3.2 million order from the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s Forest Service to supply MT-4E repeater systems to all nine forest regions throughout the United States. The rugged repeater systems ensure the maintenance of day-to-day operations and the safety of Forest Service personnel and co-operators in remote locations. These systems also provide critical communications during emergency situations, including wildfires and law enforcement activities.</text>
