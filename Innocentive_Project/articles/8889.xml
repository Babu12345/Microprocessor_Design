  <text>Make sure you're prepared for the busiest shopping day of the year: November 25. Use the TGI Black Friday app for iPhone or Android to compare all the best deals with the click of a button. App users can view ads and deals from most major retailers, including Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and Sears. In addition, the app sends push notifications of new ads as they appear. The app, created by Ecatcher Incorporated, contains more than 10,000 Black Friday deals across stores and categories, and users can create a personal shopping list to check off items as they go. Share any great deals you find with friends on Facebook and Twitter, and email your shopping list to yourself or others. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or the Android App Market.
