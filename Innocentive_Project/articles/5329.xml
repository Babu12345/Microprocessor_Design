  <text>The Boeing Company has won three competitive proposals resulting in U.S. Army technology investment agreements with a combined value of more than $19 million. The agreements with the Army's aviation applied technology directorate cover applied research and development in support of the rotor durability Army technology objective (ATO) and the high performance rotary wing vehicle designs (HPRWVD) program. As part of the rotor durability ATO efforts, Boeing will work to improve the durability and performance of helicopter rotor blades by developing and testing permanent blade-erosion protection, reliable and maintainable icing protection, improved blade repairability and increased rotor performance concepts. In support of the HPRWVD program, Boeing will design and evaluate an unloaded, lift-offset rotor system that includes a non-rotating wing positioned above the rotor to provide lift in forward flight. The system is projected to meet or exceed the Army's vibration- and noise-reduction goals while enabling higher speeds. The third agreement supports the rotor durability ATO and involves evaluating and demonstrating new, more reliable methods of transferring power and data across the non-rotating airframe to the rotating blade interface.</text>
