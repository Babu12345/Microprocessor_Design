Navmar Applied Sciences, Warminster, Pa., is being awarded a $11,207,449 modification to a previously awarded cost-plus-fixed-fee, firm-fixed-price contract to exercise an option for the procurement of hardware in support of the persistent surveillance unmanned aerial system (PSUAS) for the U.S. Army. This effort includes the procurement of 15 additional Tiger Shark PSUAS air vehicles and 15 i200 turrets, which will be integrated into the PSUAS. Work will be performed in Fairfax, Va.; Afghanistan; and Raleigh, N.C., and is expected to be completed in January 2014. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, N.J., is the contracting activity. </text>
