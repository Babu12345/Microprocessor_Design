  <text>Outback Steakhouse has pledged $1 million to Operation Homefront, a nonprofit organization that provides emergency and morale support for active troops, veterans and their families. The public can help the restaurant chain meet its obligation by dining at Outback restaurants in the United States during the month of March and ordering off the "Red, White and Bloomin'" menu. Proceeds from those orders will go toward the $1 million donation. Anyone who wants to donate $5 directly to Operation Homefront can text "HERO" to 50555.
