  <text>The U.S. Army's Tank and Automotive Command has awarded General Dynamics a $14 million contract to purchase long-lead materials for the production of 140 M1A1 SA (situational awareness) tanks for the Iraq program. The SA enhancements include a second generation forward-looking infrared (FLIR) thermal sight, a driver's vision enhancer thermal viewer and Tank Urban Survivability Kit improvements which provide better crewÂ  protection in urban warfare environments.</text>
