Contractor will provide aerospace systems technology development focused on technology research areas, which include but are not limited to flight-control laws, automation, autonomy, cooperative control and vehicle integrity management. Simulation-based research and development capabilities will be focused on constructive simulation, virtual simulation, hardware-in-the-loop simulation, flight test, multidisciplinary design activities and application of related tools/techniques needed to develop, evaluate, analyze and mature aerospace systems technologies and/or systems capabilities. Work will be performed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and is expected to be complete by June 14, 2021. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with two offers received. Fiscal year 2014 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $288,308 are being obligated at the time of award. Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-15-D-2516).
