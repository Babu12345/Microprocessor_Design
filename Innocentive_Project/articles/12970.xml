  <text>Raytheon Co., El Segundo, California, has been awarded a $7,051,595 contract (FA8650-14-C-5502) for the Affordable Radio Frequency Multifunction Sensors (ARMS) program. Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Electronic Systems, Linthicum Heights, Maryland, has been awarded a $3,750,297 contract (FA8650-14-C-5503). The ARMS program will focus on developing new manufacturing processes to enable an increase in reliability and a decrease in cycle time and costs for Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) sensors. The emphasis will be on addressing key manufacturing issues while decreasing the program risk and increasing the manufacturing readiness level to 6. Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Manufacturing Technology Division, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio is the contracting activity.Â </text>
