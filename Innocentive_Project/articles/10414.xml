L-3 KEO, Northampton, Mass., is being awarded a potential $54,936,636 firm-fixed-price and cost-plus-fixed fee contract for production of 16 Universal Modular Masts (UMM) and 142,000 hours of engineering services. The UMM is a non-hull penetrating mast that is installed on Virginia-class submarines that serves as a lifting mechanism for five different sensors including the Photonics Mast Program, High Data Rate Mast, Multi-Functional Mast, Multi-Functional Modular Mast and Integrated Electronic Signal Monitoring Mast. Each sensor is mounted on a UMM. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
