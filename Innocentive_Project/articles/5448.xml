  <text>Patriot Paws trains dogs to work with injured military members and other disabled persons to help restore physical and emotional freedoms. The organization provides high-quality service dogs for the minimum possible price to those who need them. Any physically disabled U.S. veteran or other American with mobile disabilities can apply for a Patriot Paws service dog by downloading the application form online or requesting one by mail. The necessary contact information is listed on the Web site. When an application is accepted, applicants are interviewed, and the organization makes every effort to find a compatible pet. Training the dogs takes 12 to 18 months and costs $20,000, so donations and volunteers are crucial to the program's success. Anyone interested in donating funds can give through the site's PayPal feature or can mail a check to the address listed online. Individuals who want to volunteer with the program can walk and bathe the dogs, run errands, help in the office, arrange fundraisers or round up donations. Foster families for the dogs also are needed. Other site features include donation news, frequently asked questions and an events page. Patriot Paws Service Dogs will raise funds with "Dogwalk in the Park" in Harry Myers Park, Rockwall, Texas, on November 8. The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
