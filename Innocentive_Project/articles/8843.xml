  <text>On Thursday, November 10, inns and bed and breakfasts around the U.S. and Canada are offering free rooms to veterans and a guest in observance of Veterans and Remembrance days. Those who served in the American armed forces can find a list of participating U.S. locations at www.bnbsforvets.org; Canadian veterans and military members can find properties in their country at www.bbcanada.com/bbforvets. Additional information about the offers also can be found on the sites. Veterans should book their rooms directly through the inns and B&amp;Bs, which may require proof of prior service. Innkeepers interested in participating can learn more on this Web page.</text>
