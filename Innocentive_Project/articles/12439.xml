  <text>Harris Corp., Palm Bay, Fla., is being awarded an $11,164,184 modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract (N00039-13-C-0001) for Commercial Broadband Satellite Program Force Level Variant (FLV) terminal systems. The Commercial Broadband Satellite Program FLV terminal system is used to provide the Navy with terminal-to-shore, space and terrestrial connectivity to significantly increase throughput of data; improve satellite communications reliability; and provide redundancy for military satellite communications. The FLV terminal systems are deployed on CVN, LPD-17 class and T-AHs ships. This contract includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of the contract to an estimated $37,497,686. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, Calif., is the contracting activity.</text>
