  <text>Aqua Comms Ltd., a provider of scalable, subsea capacity-based network solutions, announced the successful completion of a trial of Cinea’s WaveLogic 3 Extreme transmission technology on American Europe Connect, its high-capacity, transatlantic subsea cable network that connects New York to London.

The test confirms that Ciena’s 150 Gb/s per wavelength 8QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) technology will expand the capacity of Aqua Comms' submarine network by 50 percent and provide greater spectral efficiency and reach over vast transoceanic distances.

America Europe Connect is designed to address the rise in transatlantic data center interconnectivity (DCI) markets and to interconnect metro networks. A key benefit of the 150 Gb/s 8QAM technology is the ability to provide high-capacity DCI to Aqua Comms’ on-demand customers. 8QAM enables 50 percent additional capacity per channel with 150 Gb/s per wavelength.</text>
