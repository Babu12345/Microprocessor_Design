  <text>Federal News Radio--WFED 1500 AM in the Washington D.C. area-- broadcasts news of interest to federal government workers and employees of federal contractors, along with a healthy smattering of hometown sports. Its biggest drawback, if you're not within 20 miles of Washington D.C., is the station's beltway-bound signal, leaving commuters and interested listeners dependent on its webstream to this point. Last week, Federal News Radio unveiled its new iPhone application.Â Among its features: a live stream of the station, updates on news stories and blog postings, Mike Causey's daily column, and... hockey games. (How about those Washington Capitals?) Check it out here.</text>
