  <text>This special travel organization offers service members and other U.S. Defense Department personnel a chance to enjoy vacations for discount prices at more than 3,500 time share properties in approximately 80 countries. Through the deals, travelers can stay at locations without buying into a time share or even attending a presentation for one, if they so choose. Several different types of deals are available including: space available, a seven-night vacation option typically during the off season and/or on very short notice for $369; high-demand weekly rentals in popular locations during peak season but at discounted commercial rates; nightly getaways; and special offers from lodging locations that may include car rentals or other discounts. 

Anyone looking for a present idea for their loved one in the military can purchase gift certificates for Armed Forces Vacation Club travel through the organization's website. A link near the bottom of the page takes veterans to a vacation site designed specifically for them; another does the same for government employees. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
