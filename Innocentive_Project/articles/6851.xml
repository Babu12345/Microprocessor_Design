  <text>Educational Foundation Launches BIG IDEA to Support STEM Teachers

AFCEA International and the AFCEA Educational Foundation have an integrated plan to deliver on the recruitment, retention and renewal of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) teachers. (See Rita Boland's recent post on the need for these teachers here.)

AFCEA will focus on those preparing to become classroom STEM teachers, offering scholarships, and supplying AFCEA STEM teachers with powerful AFCEA Science Teaching Tools grants (STTools) for use in their classrooms and activities.

AFCEA International will grant the AFCEA Educational Foundation $200,000 per year over the next three years, FY 2010-2012.  The grant will enable the Foundation to award 35 scholarships of $5,000 each per year, for a total of $175,000.  (Click here for more information.)

The program will focus on one AFCEA Chapter community each of the 3 years, awarding 5 scholarships and allocating $25,000 in Science Teaching Tools.  In 2010, it will be the Hawaii Chapter.

In addition to the STEM Teacher Scholarship, each graduating STEM Scholarship Teacher will receive a $1,000- AFCEA STTools grant for 3 years, providing they remain teaching a STEM subject.</text>
