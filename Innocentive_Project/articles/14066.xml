  <text>Mark Orndorff, the mission assurance executive and program executive officer for mission assurance and network operations (NetOps) at the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), bids farewell to colleagues today as he retires.

Ornorff’s permanent replacement has yet to be publicly named. Until then, John Hickey, the program manager for Defense Department mobility at DISA, will serve as the interim mission assurance executive.

"I've been with the government for over 36 years and with DISA for over 21 years," Orndorff said. 

Orndorff also had served as the chief of DISA’s Field Security Operations organization, working as the single information assurance (IA) certification authority within DISA to support accreditation decisions for all DISA systems and networks. He also was responsible for the execution of significant portions of DISA’s IA program, including implementation and management of Defense Department Enterprise Solutions; development and maintenance of Security Technical Implementation Guides, checklists and evaluation scripts; development and maintenance of the Defense Department’s NetOps and IA training program; and development of a NetOps and Computer Network Defense Service Provider certification program. </text>
