  <text>The U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory trained Marines-for the first time ever-using multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in a convoy. Seven Marines were trained on the Oshkosh Corporation's UGV, which uses the company's TerraMax technology to operate autonomously. TerraMax integrates high-power computers, intelligence, drive-by-wire technology and distributed sensing systems. One operator supervised the control of two vehicles, even in black-out mode during night operations. The vehicles navigated a variety of terrain, including sand trails, clay roads, overgrown trails and narrow creek crossings. They also adjusted speeds to maintain proper intravehicle spacing. The event was part of the Marine Corps' evaluation of the Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement system. It took place during the laboratory's Marine Air-Ground Task Force Limited Objective Experiment, July 24 to August 5, at Fort Pickett, Virginia. The experiment assessed technologies and capabilities being developed for future missions.</text>
