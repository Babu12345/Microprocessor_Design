  <text>CACI International Incorporated has been awarded a five-year, $150 million task order by the U.S. Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command to modernize maintenance applications used at shipyards and maintenance centers through information technology upgrades and software development. The work awarded through the task order will consolidate approximately 15 maintenance contracts for information technology activities at various naval facilities, which will provide the Navy with a single source for modernizing ship maintenance applications, developing new maintenance technologies and rolling applications out to new locations. This work will make the entire maintenance process more efficient and economical.</text>
