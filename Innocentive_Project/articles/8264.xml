  <text>General Dynamics Information Technology, Fairfax, Virginia, has been awarded a task order through the U.S. General Services Administration's Alliant Contract to support the relocation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's headquarters. The task order has a ceiling value of $876 million and duration of seven years if all options are exercised. As part of the relocation, General Dynamics will provide a seamless, state-of-the-art information-technology (IT) infrastructure that meets the computer networking, telecommunications, building management and physical-security requirements of the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters. General Dynamics will install and maintain components that include: information technology networks and systems, along with data, video and audio/visual equipment; telecommunications, including telephony and accompanying networks and wiring; physical security elements such as video cameras, identification card readers and control access points, all integrated for easy monitoring; and building management systems such as the electronic information boards in parking garages that will need to be operated and maintained.</text>
