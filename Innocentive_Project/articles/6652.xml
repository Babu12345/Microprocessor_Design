  <text>"If we wish to know the force of human genius, we should read Shakespeare. If we wish to see the insignificance of human learning, we may study his commentators."--William Hazlitt It's almost time for students to head back to school. Don't contribute to the insignificance of human learning by failing to understand Shakespeare. Use the free Shakespeare app for access to the literary genius' complete works. The application features the full text of all 40 plays as well as the Bard's six poems and 154 sonnets. Users can change the font color and font size for easier reading. The app remembers the last viewed page for each work and has options for easy scrolling. For the overachieving student, Shakespeare Pro offers more features for $2.99. The Pro application has a glossary of terms, quotes, facts about Shakespeare and his work, bookmarks, scene breakdowns and line numbers, and abbreviated versions of the plays aimed at younger audiences. Shakespeare and Shakespeare Pro are available for download for iPhones and iPod Touch on iTunes.
