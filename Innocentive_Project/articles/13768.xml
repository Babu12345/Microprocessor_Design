  <text>General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada recently announced the Canadian Government has awarded the company a CDN $287 million ($252, 295,000 U.S.) contract to General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada for the provision and integration of an enhanced surveillance suite on to Canadian LAV III Upgrade vehicles, known as LAV 6.0.

The upgraded surveillance system will include a 10-meter retractable mast, an Operator Control Station and a surveillance suite inclusive of radar, thermal/day and image intensification sights, laser range finder and Global Positioning System mounted on a stabilized platform. These enhancements will allow for superior detection ranges, on-the-move operation, integrated silent watch power management and the transmission of images through the communications system. Deliveries of LAV 6.0 vehicles equipped with the upgraded surveillance suite will begin in December 2016.</text>
