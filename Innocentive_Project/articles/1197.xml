  <text>SIGNAL is without doubt the premier technical journal for C4I in the United States and internationally. SIGNAL also has become in recent years a magazine replete with visionary, balanced commentary and upbeat news about AFCEA programs and membership, corporate as well as individual. The AFCEA scholarship program, for example, surpasses in dollars and quality the programs of all the other military associations because AFCEA has put its resources into our future.—Gen. John A. Wickham, USA (Ret.) As SIGNAL Magazine celebrates its 60th anniversary, I continue to believe that it is one of the most important benefits of being a member of AFCEA. The worldwide reputation of SIGNAL Magazine as a premier professional journal is well deserved, and the team that works so hard to produce SIGNAL every month is one of the most dedicated teams in the profession. Congratulations SIGNAL and press on. —Adm. James Busey, USN (Ret.) SIGNAL Magazine has been an integral part of my career and retirement reading. As an electronic warfare officer in my early career, the technologies featured in SIGNAL greatly enhanced my professional knowledge. As a senior manager in intelligence assignments, I could always count on SIGNAL to keep me abreast of changes in information technology worldwide. Now, in retirement, SIGNAL is the primary way I have to keep track of what’s going on the in the ever-changing environment we call information technology. Congratulations SIGNAL on your 60th anniversary. You have established the standard for professional journals.—Lt. Gen. C. Norman Wood, USAF (Ret.)</text>
