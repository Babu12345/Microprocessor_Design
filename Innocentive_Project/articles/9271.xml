  <text>Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Fort Worth, Texas, is being awarded a $24,138,848 modification to a previously awarded cost-reimbursement contract for the development of a data farm for the Joint Strike Fighter U.S. Reprogramming Laboratory to be located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The data farm will interface with lab's prime mission equipment and is used to store software and data from the F-35 mission data testing. The ability to store and retrieve data is critical for mission data production, which is vital to program execution. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
