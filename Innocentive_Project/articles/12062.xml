  <text>The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy recently joined with a coalition of private-sector partners from the telecommunications industry to expand the Warriors 4 Wireless pilot program, a new nonprofit effort aimed at connecting veterans and returning service members to jobs in the rapidly growing wireless telecommunications industry. The program is designed to help address the shortage of skilled jobs for returning veterans while satisfying the wireless industryâ€™s immediate need for skilled employees. The intent is to make it easier for veterans to obtain civilian training and certifications.
	Warriors 4 Wireless builds on a Veterans Information Technology Training and Certification program. The pilot program was launched in Washington, D.C., in 2012, achieving an 86 percent job-placement rate for the more than 50 participating veterans. The program will now become a nationwide initiative.</text>
