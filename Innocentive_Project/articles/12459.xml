  <text>Engineering Services Network (ESN) Inc., Arlington, Va., announced recently that it has won a $700,000 contract to support the 99th Communication Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, NV. The contract is being managed by the 38th Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group (38 CEIG) at Tinker Air Force Base, OK. Under the contract, ESN will support moving the 99th Communication Squadron into a new communications facility. The company will move all aspects of the Nellis AFN Network Control Center into a new building. In addition, ESN will provide a new design that uses state-of-the-art equipment and server virtualization to improve IT availability and response time to the personnel at Nellis AFB while reducing power requirements. </text>
