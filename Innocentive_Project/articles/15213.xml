  <text>Corp Ten International, Towson, Maryland, is being awarded a $14.3 million indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for services and materials required to support the existing surveillance data collection system (DCS), including hardware, software, airtime, technical and engineering services. This acquisition will procure the support to maintain the existing DCS, as well as modify the system per mission requirements. The existing DCS integrates all sensors and transmitters currently used in a comprehensive client-server architecture that is expandable to accommodate new sensors, transmitters and communication systems. Work will be performed in Dahlgren, Virginia (95 percent); Key West, Florida (1 percent); Tampa, Florida (1 percent); Santa Barbara, California (1 percent); Baltimore (1 percent); and Washington, D.C. (1 percent), and is expected to be completed in September 2018. Fiscal 2015 procurement (defense agencies) funding in the amount of $275,500 will be obligated at time of award and will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1—only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Dahlgren, Virginia, is the contracting activity (N00178-15-D-2023).</text>
