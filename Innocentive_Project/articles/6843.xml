  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation has been awarded a contract to supply machinery automation systems for two mine countermeasures vessels being sold by the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence to the Lithuanian Navy. The contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman's Sperry Marine unit by Thales U.K., the prime contractor for the refit and upgrade. The two ships will be fitted with Sperry Marine's commercial machinery automation system, which provides an integrated and flexible network for monitoring and controlling the ships' engines and auxiliary systems.</text>
