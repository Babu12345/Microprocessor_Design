  <text>Rockwell Collins Incorporated, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is being awarded a $20,808,237 cost-plus-award-fee and cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for the Modernized User Equipment (MUE) completion effort. This effort corrects MUE receiver card deficiencies that were identified during functional qualification testing, in order for the receiver cards to comply with contract requirements.  This effort also implements updated MUE interface control documents; adds functionality to delivered military-code Global Positioning System receivers to provide additional military utility; and increases performance design margin in functions within receivers for future military-code receiver developments. The location of the performance is Cedar Rapids, Iowa. SMC/GPK, El Segundo, California, is the contracting activity.</text>
