  <text>It might be a surprise to most who deal with cybersecurity in the government sector, but cybersecurity experts in the commercial sector believe there are many "pockets of excellence" in the .gov and .mil domain.

Chris Coleman, Director of Cybersecurity, U.S. Public Sector, Cisco Systems, believes that one of the most "robust government systems" when it comes to cyberprotection can be found in the U.S. Congress on the servers of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Coleman spoke to a panel discussion on cybersecurity on the final day of the MILCOM 2011 conference in Baltimore.

Asked to discuss what college areas of study yield the best cybersecurity experts, Coleman raised eyebrows when he replied Â that some of the best analysts he's worked with come from the social sciences and even the fine arts.

Marcus Sachs, Vice President for National Security and Cybersecurity, Verizon, said that for entry level positions in his firm, he actually looks for young people who can express themselves and are "socially alert and experts in social media."

Michele Weslander-Quaid, Chief Technology Officer (Federal), Google, believes both government and commercial cybersecurity officials need to realize that young adults among the ranks of civilians and young enlistees in the ranks of the military "are your best cyberfolks" because of their exposure to the complete spectrum of digital devices.</text>
