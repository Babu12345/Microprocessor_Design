  <text>The Boeing Company, St. Louis, is being awarded a $27,497,699 modification to a firm-fixed-price delivery order 0140 previously issued against Basic Ordering Agreement (N00019-11-G-0001) for an F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G automated maintenance environment (AME). AME is a suite of integrated software application designed to support the “O” level maintenance activity by providing enhanced procedural and technical support and data collection for performance analysis and trending. Work will be performed in St. Louis, Missouri, and is expected to be completed in December 2015. Fiscal 2014 and 2015 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales funds in the amount of $27,497,699 are being obligated on this award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
