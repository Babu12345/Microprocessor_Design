  <text>QinetiQ North America, Reston, Va., has announced that it was awarded a three-year, potential $12 million strategic contract for ocean modeling, remote sensing, and physical oceanography programs to support the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi. One of the primary projects included in this contract is to continue developing the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). HYCOM is a new global, high-resolution ocean prediction system that improves situational awareness and the ability to predict future ocean environments. Another key project is the HYCOM 20-Year Reanalysis Project, which will generate full-resolution historical ocean records from 1992 to the present. Additional projects include predicting Arctic ice parameters, improving sea surface temperature measurements from space, running high-resolution models for expeditionary warfare exercises and satellite calibration.</text>
