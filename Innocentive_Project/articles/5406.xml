  <text>Interest is high in the area of blue force tracking capabilities for the battlespace, but the U.S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) also is interested in people-tracking of another kind, the kind that can help the command ensure that it is doing its job as primary conventional force provider. JFCOM is soliciting industry and academia input on existing technologies to improve the process of tracking the forces it provides to worldwide operations. A notice of the solicitation is in Federal Business Opportunities; all submissions on the topic must be made by October 30 and must contain information on how to support several business processes across all organizations that provide joint forces and several cross-cutting but common joint force-providing processes. In addition, five distinct, integrated capabilities must be detailed in the submission that show how the solutions are service-oriented-network-enabled; collaborative in direct and indirect ways; include a process workflow engine; feature enterprise content management; and incorporate decision-support reporting. </text>
