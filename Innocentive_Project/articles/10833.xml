  <text>Iris Technology Corp., Irvine, Calif., is being awarded $7,811,874 for firm-fixed-price delivery order #0002 under previously awarded contract for the procurement of 1,563 solar power adaptors (SPA II) in support of the program manager, Expeditionary Power Systems. The 1,563 solar power adaptors will be procured to meet continuing need for these items in support of on-going deployed operations, equipment reset, and commonality across the Marine Corps. The second generation solar power adaptor (SPA II) is the solar energy collector, electronic control, and energy storage mechanism of a tactically deployable renewable energy system that is light enough to be man-portable. The SPA II is planned for usage by the various Marine Corps communities in rugged and austere environments to power radios, computers, and charge multiple types of batteries. The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Va., is the contracting activity.</text>
