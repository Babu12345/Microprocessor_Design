  <abstract>Help send stuffed Christmas stockings to deployed troops. </abstract>
  <text>Looking for a chance to spread some Christmas cheer to deployed service members? Operation Holiday Stockings is striving to send gifts to 1,600 troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and other locations in Asia. The public can participate in several ways: donate time and make a stocking (see the Make Stockings page for directions and stocking-stuffer ideas); buy a stocking and mail it to the organization; create and contribute a Christmas card that the organization can send along with the stockings; or donate money toward shipping costs and the purchase of stocking stuffers. Operation Holiday Stockings estimates it costs about $1 in postage for each stocking sent.

For more information visit the website or email Sue at ramsddj@aol.com. All donations can be mailed to:
Operation Holiday Stockings
P.O. Box 3186
Sequim, WA 98382

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
