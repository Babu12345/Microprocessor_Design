  <text>BBN Technologies has been awarded $8.9 million in funding by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under the third phase of the disruption tolerant networking (DTN) program. The DTN program's primary goal is to develop and field network services that deliver critical information reliably. Under this latest award, BBN will integrate the DTN system into fielded military networks that may combine several types of nodes, including wireless, satellite and vehicle-mounted. </text>
