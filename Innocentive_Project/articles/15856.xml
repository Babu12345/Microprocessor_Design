  <text>Readiness Management Support L.C., Panama City, Florida, is being awarded a $16,721,185 modification to a previously awarded cost-plus-fixed-fee contract (N65236-09-C-6872) for a ceiling increase and period of performance extension of 90 days to June 30, 2016; and three one-month options to September 30, 2016, to provide continued aviation command and control operations and maintenance services in support of the Air Force Central Command. This contract included four options which, as a result of this modification, would bring the cumulative ceiling value of this contract to $484,569,843. Work will be performed in Southwest Asia and is expected to continue via award of the follow-on task orders in April 2016. No funds will be obligated at the time of award. Contract funds in the amount of $16,721,185 will expire at the end of the fiscal year. This contract was previously procured on a competitive basis with two offers received via the Commerce Business Daily’s Federal Business Opportunities website and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center e-Commerce Central website. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic, Charleston, South Carolina, is the contracting activity (N65236-09-C-6872).</text>
