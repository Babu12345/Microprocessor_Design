  <text>Data Link Solutions LLC has received a $32 million, firm-fixed-price, cost-reimbursement contract to provide multi-functional information distribution system (MIDS) on ship (MOS) and associated Link 16 systems. The MOS provides high power Link 16 shipboard systems by integrating the MIDS low volume terminal into the shipboard tactical data link environment. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command awarded the contract on behalf of its organizational partner, the U.S. Navy's program executive office for command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. The contract includes four one-year options that could bring the cumulative value to an estimated $160.6 million.</text>
