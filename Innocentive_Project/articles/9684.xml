  <text>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is actively seeking partners to conduct research in the newly opened Cybersecurity Technologies Research Laboratory (CTRL). SNL held the grand opening for the facility at the Livermore Valley Open Campus on June 12. The CTRL offers the capability to run experiments and freely discuss a wide range of cyber research issues. Additionally, U.S. and international users can collaborate without some of the unrelated restrictions that are often associated with a national laboratory. Broadly, the CTRL will promote stronger relationships between industry, academia and national laboratories in the research and development of cybersecurity solutions through technology, practices and policy.</text>
