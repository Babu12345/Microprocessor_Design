  <text>AT&amp;T Mobility L.L.C., Hanover, Maryland; Sprint-Nextel, Reston, Virginia; T-Mobile USA Incorporated, Bellevue, Washington; and Verizon Wireless, Laurel, Maryland, are each being awarded contract modifications to previously awarded indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, multiple award task order contracts supporting the Department of Navy (DoN) Wireless Services Program. This modification will increase the ceiling amount of the option period by $77,600,000 and will extend the option period by four months for each of the four contracts. This effort is necessary to enable DoN to meet its wireless service requirements due to an increased usage and influx of former Navy/Marine Corps Intranet contract users. These four contractors may compete for task orders under the terms and conditions of the awarded contract. NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center, San Diego, California, is the contracting activity.</text>
