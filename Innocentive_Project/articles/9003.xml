  <text>Is your New Year's resolution to get your finances in order? If so, the Bills app for the iPhone or iPad could help you track and control how much you spend each month. The Bills app, developed by iBear LLC, allows you to set a monthly budget and mark due dates for bills and payments on a calendar. Then track and filter your bills using special boxes to show planned, overdue and paid expenses. The app is designed to look like a real office, complete with a projector, folders, drawers and a flip board reflecting all the features. In addition, the tool lets you export your financial plans and set up a PIN code to protect your information. For a limited time, purchase the Bills for iPhone or iPad apps on sale for $0.99 in the iTunes App Store.
