Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co., Sunnyvale, Calif., has been awarded a $75,230,383 modification to the existing fiscal 2013-2016 Contractor Logistics Support, Legacy Sustainment, and Combined Task Force Support contract for the Space Based Infrared System Survivable Endurable Evolution (S2E2), Increment 1. The total cumulative face value of the contract is $181,098,565. This contract modification is for permanent sustainment modifications to the current Mobile Ground System (MGS) to enable processing of Defense Support Program and SBIRS geosynchronous orbit satellites mission data and to perform limited contingency SBIRS GEO satellite commanding. This project also replaces the existing Intermediate Maintenance Facility with the Maintenance and Operations Support Suite used for pre-deployment preparation on the S2E2 MGS Force Packages, and to provide maintainer and limited operator training. The Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Infrared Space Systems Directorate Contracting Division is the contracting activity.  </text>
