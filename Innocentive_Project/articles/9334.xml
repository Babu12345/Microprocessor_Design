  <text>Soldiers now can purchase 12 mobile training apps from the newly launched Army Software Marketplace. The apps, developed through the Connecting Soldiers to Digital Applications initiative, are approved for Army-wide use and available at www.marketplace.army.mil. Currently, the store supports publicly facing apps on personal iOS devices. However, once fully implemented, the marketplace will deliver Web-based and downloadable programs for all approved devices. "This prototype is a first step in establishing and exercising new submission and approval processes that will eventually enable Army members, organizations and third-party developers to release applications for Army-wide distribution," explains Lt. Gen. Susan Lawrence, USA, chief information officer/G-6.  These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
