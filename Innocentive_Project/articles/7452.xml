  <text>The aggression recently shown by North Korea against South Korea may be just the start of a dangerous period with that rogue nation. North Korea has begun a leadership transition that, if history is any judge, could be violent and destructive for its neighbors and adversaries. Adm. Robert F. Willard, USN, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, told an audience at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2010 that the transition from Kim Jong-Il to his son Kim Jong-Un will be happening much more quickly than the transition that brought the elder Kim to power.

Kim Jong-Il now is in failing health, and his son may follow the same path in a more compressed timetable, Adm. Willard warned. And, North Korea has a burgeoning cyberspace capability.
