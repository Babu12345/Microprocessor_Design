  <text>The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is seeking comments on a request for proposals partial draft in preparation for contracting a company to operate a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) that will focus solely on securing U.S. information systems. The plan is to award a single indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with firm fixed price, labor hour or cost reimbursement task orders. Currently, the proposed base period for the maximum $400 million contract is five years. A federal staff will provide overall management of the center.
	Three major task areas have been identified: reach, development, engineering and technical support; program/project management; and facilities management.
	The NCCoE operates under the Information Technology Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which is holding an industry day on January 8. Online registration to attend the event must be received by January 6. Comments on the NCCoEâ€™s partial draft must be received by 5 p.m. EST, January 17.</text>
