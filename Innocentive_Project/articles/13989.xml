  <text>Argon ST Incorporated, Smithfield, Pennsylvania, is being awarded a $6,532,838 modification to a previously awarded contract (N00024-12-D-6216) for the procurement of five AN/SLQ-25A/C countermeasure decoy systems and spares that provide improved naval defense for current threat torpedoes in support of the Undersea Defensive Warfare Programs. The AN/SLQ-25A/C is a digitally controlled, modular design, electro-acoustic softkill countermeasure decoy system. It employs an underwater towed body acoustic projector, which is deployed astern by a fiber optic tow cable including dual tow capability, enhanced torpedo countermeasures, and the littoral fiber optic tow cable. The system defends ships against wake homing, acoustic homing and wire guided torpedoes. Work will be performed in Smithfield, Pennsylvania, and is expected to be completed by September 2016. Fiscal 2014 and 2015 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding in the amount of $6,532,838 will be obligated at time of award. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
