  <text>Save interesting articles on your computer and read them later on your iPhone, even if you don't have Internet access. The Instapaper app, developed by Marco Arment, lets you bookmark any article, blog or story on the Web. Once the page is marked, it is saved into the app. You can then access and read it at any time, even if you're offline. Use it to mark long articles and blog posts you find during the day but don't have time to read. Simply flag the post on your computer using the Read Later bookmark, and access it on your smart phone at any time. The app downloads a text-only version of each page and uses ideal formatting to make the selections more readable. You can browse your complete reading history from anywhere. Download the app for free in the iTunes App Store, and use it on your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.
