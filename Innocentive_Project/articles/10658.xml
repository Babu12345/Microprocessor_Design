Raytheon Co., Tucson, Ariz., is being awarded a $9,817,530 cost-plus-fixed-fee modification to previously awarded letter contract for an alternative architecture study in support of the Cobra Judy Replacement (CJR) program. The CJR program designs, develops, and acquires a functional replacement ship and mission equipment suite for the current Cobra Judy and USNS Observation Island. The CJR mission is the same as that of the system it replaces—long-dwell foreign ballistic missile data collection in support of international treaty verification. The mission systems onboard the replacement ship includes high-power, instrumentation-class S-band and X-band radar phased arrays and the necessary ancillary equipment to support the mission. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity. </text>
