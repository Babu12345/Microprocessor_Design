  <text>Innovative Signal Analysis, Richardson, Texas, has been awarded a $12,971,119 cost-plus-fixed fee completion contract for TACOMA software and hardware system. The contractor will develop and demonstrate enabling technologies and algorithms to improve upon a capability to automatically collect, process, characterize, identify and fingerprint priority signals of interest that may have advanced modulation and low-probability of intercept features. This effort will assist the Air Force in the enhancement of electronic intelligence collection and processing capabilities across multiple ISR sensing sources. System performance requirements in terms of detection and characterization of priority radar waveforms will be assessed. The resulting technology developed under this effort will enable the real-time detection, tracking and geo-location of emerging radar systems. Work will be performed in Richardson, Texas, and is expected to be complete by November 28, 2018. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with two offers received. Fiscal year 2014 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $5,000 are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, New York, is the contracting activity (FA8750-15-C-0012).
