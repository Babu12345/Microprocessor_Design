  <text>Boston-based DRG has been contracted to deliver an additional 55 Ageon intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems to Afghanistan as part of an undisclosed program, bringing the total number to 75. Initially deployed with new ground control shelters, Ageon ISR is now being used to upgrade all existing shelters across the program. Ageon ISR supports multi-intelligence processing, exploitation, and dissemination. Warfighters operating from these shelters use Ageon ISR to fuse high-definition video, wide area imagery, radar, unattended ground sensor, acoustic and human intelligence data to support force protection and intelligence operations.</text>
