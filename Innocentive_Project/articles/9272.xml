  <text>Catastrophically wounded or ill service members and people involved in their care can access the Special Compensation for Assistance with Activities of Daily Living (SCAADL) calculator to determine the amount of stipend they can receive to help cover nonmedical expenses. Authorized under the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, SCAADL is a monthly compensation for eligible service members who require assistance with daily living or who are at high risk for personal safety and cannot live independently.

The amount of compensation is based on a troop's level of dependency, the caregiver assistance required and local wage rates. Qualification requirements are posted online. Service members suffering catastrophic physical conditions and their caregivers can reach out to primary care managers or care coordinators to discuss eligibility for this program.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
