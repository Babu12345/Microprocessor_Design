  <abstract>Confyrm, GSMA and MorphoTrust win contracts from NSTIC to secure identities better.</abstract>
  <text>The National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) announced three new pilot programs this morning worth approximately $3 million. An additional almost $7 million is allocated for continued efforts in subsequent years.

Confyrm was awarded the largest contract, valued at around $1.2 million. It will pilot a shared signals solution to mitigate the impact of account takeovers and fake accounts through early fraud detection and notification with special emphasis on consumer privacy.

GSMA and MorphoTrust each won contracts for approximately $800,000. GSMA is creating a common interoperable approach that will allow consumers and businesses to leverage mobile devices for secure, privacy-enhancing identity and access management.

MorphoTrust will work in partnership with the North Carolina departments of Transportation and Health and Human Services to demonstrate how existing credentials such as driver's licenses can be extended online to enable new types of online services.

Jeremy Grant, senior executive advisor, NSTIC, explained the three new pilot programs today at the Global Identity Summit in Tampa. Originally, 42 organizations submitted abbreviated applications in March. Eight were chosen to provide full proposals from which NSTIC selected the three awardees.</text>
