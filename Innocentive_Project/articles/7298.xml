  <text>Three Phoenix Incorporated, Fairfax, Virginia, is being awarded a nearly $6 million firm-fixed-price modification to previously awarded contract for a technology insertion photonics mast. The procurement of this mast will allow for the continued engineering assessment, design and development of a non-developmental item submarine optronics system.  The Small Business Innovative Research Phase III contract is to provide engineering services to support software development, procurement of commercial off-the-shelf products, and hardware/software integration required to provide improved technology for U.S. Navy open architecture and network centric operations, and warfare systems in support of USS Virginia class submarine and other submarine/surface ship systems. Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
