  <text>Prepare your family for the challenges of deployment with this comprehensive iPhone app-free for a limited time. The Soldier/Family Deployment Handbook app provides resources to help soldiers and their loved ones make it through difficult situations, including unique information for those in the National Guard or Reserve. The app, developed by ForceReadiness.com, includes alphabetical listings of local services, agencies and programs; checklists for soldiers and their spouses; information on how to manage separation; predeployment considerations; ID card and family member information storage; and a helpful financial worksheet. In addition, users can access problem-solving matrices, which show different solutions to common issues experienced during deployment. A special section exists for those families living overseas. Download this app for free in the iTunes App Store for a limited time, down from the normal price of $0.99.
