  <text>SIGNAL's next webinar will be on February 26 at 11 a.m. and features Kurt Dickey, Unified Communications Specialist at Cisco Federal. From the description:

Organizations that maintain separate voice and data networks are confronted with the challenge of increasing productivity while reducing costs.

One answer to this challenge is deploying a converged network unified communications solution. In order to be effective, such a solution must offer flexible and sophisticated functionality and framework that permits rapid deployment of emerging applications such as desktop IP telephony, unified messaging, telepresence, mobility, desktop collaboration, enterprise application integration with IP phone displays, and collaborative IP contact centers. These applications enhance productivity and increase enterprise revenues.
