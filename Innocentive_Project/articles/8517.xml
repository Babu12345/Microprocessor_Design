  <text>This website is both heartwarming and simple. Military families submit the videos and stories of their loved ones' return from deployment for others to enjoy. The content allows creators to share their happiness while the general public receives a personal glimpse into the sacrifices made by the defense community. By piping content to Facebook, Welcome Home Blog creates an interactive environment in which people can connect and communicate. Those who would like to share their videos can send content to welcomehomeblog@gmail.com. When you visit the site, be warned-you might want to keep a box of tissues handy.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
