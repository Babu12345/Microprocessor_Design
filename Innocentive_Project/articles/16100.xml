  <text>Praxis Engineering Technologies Inc., Annapolis Junction, Maryland, has been awarded a $12,555,564 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for research and development in Leveraging the Analog Domain for Security program. Contractor will provide multi-model analog sensing to adaptively determine what features to compute from signals emitted by a device during training and testing, extracting sub-bands of interest, de-noising the individual signals and removing interfering transmission by other devices in the vicinity. Work will be performed at Annapolis Junction, Maryland, and is expected to be complete by July 15, 2020. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition with 45 offers received. Fiscal 2015 and 2016 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $3,619,969 are being obligated at the time of award. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-16-C-7628).
