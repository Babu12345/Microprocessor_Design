  <text>L-3 Link Simulation &amp; Training recently announced the first international sale of its Advanced Helmet Mounted Display to Raytheon Australia in support of the Royal Australian Air Force's Hornet Aircrew Training System. The award calls for L-3 Link to provide Advanced Helmet Mounted DisplaysÂ  to support pilot training on the RAAF's three F/A-18 Tactical Readiness Trainers. L-3 Link's Advanced Helmet Mounted Display will replace current fixed field-of-view flat panel displays, enabling pilots to view out-the-window imagery and systems symbology over a 360-degree field-of-regard.</text>
