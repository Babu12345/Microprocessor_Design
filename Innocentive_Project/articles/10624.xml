  <text>The U.S. Marine Corps may tap the expertise of Asia-Pacific treaty allies and partners if the Corps faces draconian cuts in its budget. Items such as operations and maintenance conceivably could be assumed by other countries if funding is lost from sequestration and/or the continuing resolution.
	Gen. James F. Amos, USMC, commandant of the Marine Corps, discussed this possibility in a media interview at AFCEA/USNI West 2013 in San Diego. The general allowed that the Corps has been examining other countriesâ€™ capabilities as it prepares to increase its Asia-Pacific presence as part of the U.S. strategic rebalancing to that region.
	No action has been taken yet because none of the services knows the extent of the budget cuts they will face, let alone where the ax will fall. The Marines are examining potential options for when they learn their fiscal fate.
	One potential drawback, the general observed, is that some of these allies and partners have budget issues of their own. Some of our closest allies are looking at declining defense budgets, which would hinder their ability to assume some U.S. activities. Again, these determinations would be made after the Marine Corps is certain where cuts will occur.</text>
