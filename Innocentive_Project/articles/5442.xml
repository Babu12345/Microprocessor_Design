  <text>The South Asia Terrorism Portal monitors terrorism events in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Recent incidents and news events are listed on the portal's main page. The site also includes an extensive, if dated (it was written in 2003), overview of South Asian security issues. Links provide information on specific national data for the region as well as events and groups operating within India. Visitors also can access online issues of Faultlines, a journal of internal security issues in South Asia.
