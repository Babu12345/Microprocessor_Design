  <text>U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Emergency Communications (OEC) is looking for solutions to communications interoperability problems along the U.S. southern and northern borders. To entice community governments to tackle these problems, the OEC is offering up to a total of $25.5 million. The Border Interoperability Demonstration Project (BIDP) is a one-time competitive grant program open to local, tribal and emergency responders along the U.S.-Mexican and Canadian-U.S. borders. At least three awards are available for each border. Funding will be allocated from the OEC through the state. The project itself is a result of the 9/11 Commission Act, which authorized the OEC to establish the BIDP. Communities interested in submitting an application for the grant money must do so no later than April 26, 2010. Questions about the program should be sent to the grants officer.</text>
