  <text>Fidelity Technologies Corporation, Reading, Pennsylvania, was recently awarded a potential $31 million contract to provide simulation training technology and logistics support to assist the U.S. Army as it prepares to transition security responsibilities to the Afghan National Army Air Corps. The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation, based in Orlando, Florida, awarded the contract. Within an 18-month period, Fidelity will deliver four simulators: MI-17 flight training device, G-222 flight training device, G-222 basic aviation training device and G-222 fuselage load trainer. The simulators will help train Afghan warfighters in support of the Combined Security Transition Command, a multinational military formation designed to train and develop security forces, including the Afghan National Army Air Corps, headquartered in Kabul.</text>
