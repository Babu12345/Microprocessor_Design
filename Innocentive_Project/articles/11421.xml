  <text>The same challenges facing the military now confront law enforcement as it embraces cyber capabilities. Disciplines ranging from data fusion to security are becoming integral parts of the curriculum for police officers.
	Cathy Lanier, chief of the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department, did not understate the changes technology has wrought as she spoke at the AFCEA Global Intelligence Forum in the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. “It almost feels like completely reinventing police work,” she said.
	With the force using information technology in most aspects of police work, cybersecurity is one of the top priorities for officers. “With all that technology, we have had to re-educate our entire police force and civilians on cybersecurity,” the chief offered. “We’ve had to change the type of employee we go after and teach the current police how to use it.”
	Chief Lanier added that training alone is not the only part of the equation. The department must bring its people up to speed on these new technologies, but it also must obtain the policy to go along with it.</text>
