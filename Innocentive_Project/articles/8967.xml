  <text>Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation, Durham, North Carolina, is being awarded a $12,705,721 other transaction modification. This work is for the Focus Center Research Program (FCRP), phase five/year two. The ongoing objective of the FCRP is the establishment of world-class technically-focused multi-university teams to engage in collaborative discovery research in areas where evolutionary research and development efforts have failed to find solutions to anticipated problems for the Defense Department and the semiconductor industry. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
