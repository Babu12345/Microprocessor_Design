  <text>The U.S. Army is well on its way to meeting federal goals for reducing or consolidating data centers, an effort that already has saved the service $56 million, officials state.

The Army has cut the number of centers across the force by about 38 percent, according to a report released February 6. Part of the consolidation plan calls for closing 1,157 Army Enterprise Data Centers. The goal over the next eight years is to bring the number to 10. Six will be located outside of the continental United States. The other four will be housed at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; Fort Knox, Kentucky; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

"Security has been a driver" of the consolidation effort, says Gary Wang, Army deputy chief information officer. "But cost efficiency has also been a benefit. The other intangible kind of benefit that industry has kind of noticed is that it forces the organization to be more agile in terms of being able to adjust to environmental kinds of things that happen."

Consolidation has decommissioned 2,848 servers and reduced floor space housing the servers by about 154,000 square feet, according to an Army news release.

Centers targeted for closure or consolidation typically host a large number of Army enterprise applications serving more than one installation. The multiuser, web-based applications perform business, warfighting, command and control and other enterprise functions, Wang says. </text>
