  <text>The Swedish Defence Material Administration (FMV) has awarded Thales Norway a contract to supply the Swedish Armed Forces with a new command and control (C2) system for helicopter units. Under the contract, Thales will be responsible for system design, integration and supply of C2  systems for Swedish helicopter units. The system will provide improved command and control capability for helicopter units deployed in national or international operations. It will be an  integrated part of the armed force's overall C2 systems, and will be interoperable with  existing mobile C2 systems in the Swedish air force and Nordic Battle Group.</text>
