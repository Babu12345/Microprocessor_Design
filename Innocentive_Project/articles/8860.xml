  <text>The NATO Command and Control System Management Agency on behalf of the NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense Program Office and in coordination with the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency, recently awarded a contract to ThalesRaytheonSystems to implement operator identified requirements in NATO's Interim Theatre Missile Defense Capability. The contract will upgrade the operational hardware and software of the interim capability to the standards being implemented in the latest configuration of NATO's Air command and Control System. The effort will upgrade the interim capability that will serve NATO's operational needs for several years and can also form the basis of an interim territorial ballistic missile defense capability.</text>
