  <text>Launched in November 2008 as part of Warrior Care Month, the National Resource Directory is a Web-based network of care coordinators, providers and partners who have resources for wounded, ill and injured service members, veterans, their families and families of the fallen as well as those who support them. The directory includes more than 10,000 medical and other services to help members of the military community achieve their goals as they progress through recovery and rehabilitation to reintegrate with the larger community. The National Resource Directory is organized into six major categories: benefits and compensation; education, training and employment; family and caregiver support; health; housing and transportation; and services and resources. It provides helpful checklists, a Frequently Asked Questions section and connections to peer support groups. All the resources on the Web site can be found through a general or state and local search tool. The U.S. Defense Department initiated the National Resource Directory in a collaborative effort with the departments of Labor and Veterans Affairs. The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
