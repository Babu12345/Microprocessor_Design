  <text>Sechan Electronics Incorporated, Lititz, Pennsylvania, is being awarded a $64,207,078 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for signal data processor - Sierra (SDP-S) production units and engineering support services in support of the Cooperative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) program. The SDP-S incorporates the Sierra II cryptographic chip to meet cryptographic modernization requirements and uses commercial-off-the-shelf components to provide an open architecture CEC system. The SDP-S provides the core of the CEC system providing the processing capability for sensor track fusion. The SDP-S assemblies are used on CEC shipboard, airborne and land mobile platforms to provide a composite networkÂ  picture. Concurrently, the company is being issued the initial firm-fixed-price delivery order in the amount $13,765,500 for 84 SDP-S assemblies. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
