  <text>DRS Laurel Technologies, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, is being awarded a $15,513,814 firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the Common Display System (CDS) Technology Insertion 12 production. The CDS is a family of display systems, which provides the Navy with an enterprise display solution on Navy surface ships with potential for U.S. Marine Corps and allied forces use. CDS was initially developed to support DDG 1000 and Aegis Modernization, but has been expanded to all Aegis CGs and DDGs, CVNs, and amphibious ships to include LHAs and LSDs, and is being considered for use in Navy aircraft and submarines. This contract includes options, which if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $96,300,000.

Work will be performed in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and is expected to be completed by April 2016. Fiscal 2015 other procurement (Navy) funding in the amount of $2,831,148 will be obligated at the time of award. Contract funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured with proposals solicited via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with two offers received. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity (N00024-15-D-5210).
