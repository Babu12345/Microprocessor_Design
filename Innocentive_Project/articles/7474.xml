  <text>Raytheon Company recently received the first production order for next-generation Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) satellite communication terminals. The initial production award is for 22 systems, consisting of 15 ship, five submarine and two shore terminals, along with other services and products; it is valued at more than $37 million. The program could potentially be valued at $1 billion over five years. NMT is a family of multi-banded ship, submarine and shore communications terminals providing the Navy and international partners, with the possibility of selected Army and Air Force users, a powerful and reliable new capability in support of its net-centric architecture. The terminals will provide all Navy military-band satellite communications up to five times the bandwidth and less size, weight and power than the systems they will replace.</text>
