  <text>Troops with lag time between the end of their military service and the beginning of their civilian careers can choose the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) for their medical insurance needs. The program offers temporary health coverage for 18 to 36 months after TRICARE eligibility ends. Those who qualify can purchase CHCBP coverage within 60 days of loss of eligibility for regular TRICARE or Transitional Assistance Management Program coverage. The program is administered by Humana Military Healthcare Services Incorporated and offers benefits comparable to TRICARE Standard. The main difference is that participants must pay the premiums of $988 per quarter for individuals and $2,213 per quarter for families.
