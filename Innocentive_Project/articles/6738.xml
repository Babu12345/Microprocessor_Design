  <text>The Boeing Company has been awarded a $324 million Foreign Military Sales contract from the Electronics Systems Command at Hanscomb Air Force Base, Massachusetts, to upgrade France's fleet of four E-3F Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft, and the fleet's ground system. The mid-life upgrade will provide the fleet with new mission computers and systems designed to enhance network-centric operations; increase mission execution capability, reliability and effectiveness; and reduce life-cycle costs.</text>
