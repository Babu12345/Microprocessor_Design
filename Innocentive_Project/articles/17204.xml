  <text>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) awarded 33 scientists $16 million through its 2017 Young Investigator Program (YIP). The winners’ research holds strong promise across several naval-relevant science and technology areas. Typical grants are $510,000 over a three-year period.

The candidates were selected from more than 360 highly qualified applicants. Awardees come from 25 academic institutions nationwide, in disciplines ranging from robotics and lasers to nanomaterials. They will use the funds to support laboratory equipment, graduate student stipends and scholarships, and other expenses critical to ongoing and planned investigational studies.

The ONR YIP is one of the nation’s oldest and most selective scientific research advancement programs. “For 32 years, this program has attracted the highest-quality researchers from across academia. It remains fiercely competitive and we are fortunate to have these top scientists working on behalf of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps," said Dr. Larry Schuette, ONR's director of research, in a written statement.
