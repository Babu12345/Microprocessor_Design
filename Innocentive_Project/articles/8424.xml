  <text>CDW-G, Vernon Hills, Illinois, is being awarded more than $10 million to procure 320 high-performance Uniplexed Information and Computing System scalable processor architecture-based servers to enable a technical refresh required for the Global Command and Control System and Tactical Combat Operations Systems of the Marine Corps. Current hardware has been in the field for over six years and is no longer under warranty and is now considered end-of-life. Likewise, the aging equipment is unable to keep pace with changes in operating software and increased technological capabilities and requirements. This purchase is for information technology capabilities that are not available within current Marine Corps enterprise supplies or contracts and are essential to the successful execution of command initiatives that are clearly needed. The Marine Corps System Command, Quantico, Virginia, is the contracting activity.</text>
