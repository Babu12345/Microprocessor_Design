  <text>The U.S. Air Force has awarded Lockheed Martin a $3.5 million contract to develop the Integrated Smart-BEAR Power System (ISBPS) for the service. The Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) program equips U.S. forces with lightweight, air-transportable assets used to establish mobile air bases. ISBPS integrates a variety of energy sources, including renewables, into the existing BEAR power grid.</text>
