  <text>Five universities have received funding to implement UTeach science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) preparatory programs, thanks to a $22.5 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The UTeach program, supported by the National Math and Science Initiative, helps generate awareness of the need for STEM education among college students interested in these fields and prepares these students for successful teaching careers. Currently, more than 6,000 students are in the UTeach program at 35 universities nationwide.
	Drexel University, Florida International University, Oklahoma State University, the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Maryland, College Park, will each receive $1.45 million to establish and support UTeach programs. Five additional UTeach programs for fall 2015 will be awarded under a competitive request for proposals (RFP) process. Proposals are due in June.
	More information about the grants and the RFP process is available from uteach.org.</text>
