  <text>Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, Largo, Florida, is being awarded an $11,014,015 modification to previously awarded contract (N00024-12-C-5231) to exercise an option for five AN/USG-3B Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Airborne Systems. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia, is the contracting activity.</text>
