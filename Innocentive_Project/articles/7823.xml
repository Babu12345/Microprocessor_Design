  <text>The U.S. Defense Department has established a Wounded Warrior Task Force (WWTF) to assist and support the care, management and transition of recovering wounded, ill and injured members of the U.S. military. Areas the task force will examine include medical and nonmedical case management, staff of wounded-warrior units, performance and accountability systems, services for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, and the effectiveness of various centers of excellence. The 14 members-seven from the Defense Department and seven others-of the WWTF have a four-year mission to provide independent advice and recommendations to the military to help ensure comprehensive services are provided to injured warfighters and their families. Individual troops, family members and the public will have opportunities to offer input as the task force develops its recommendations.
