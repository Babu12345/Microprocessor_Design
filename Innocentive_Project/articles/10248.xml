  <text>Turns out that supporting the military just might be a laughing matter. Stand Up for Heroes is an evening of comedy and music during the New York Comedy Festival put on to build morale among and raise money for wounded warfighters, veterans and their families. The funds go to the Bob Woodruff Foundation, a nonprofit organization investing in national and community-based programs that connect members of the military community with help they need.
	This year’s event takes place at the Beacon Theatre on Thursday, November 8, at 8 p.m. It will honor the sacrifices of troops and their families, offering support in the effort to heal physically and psychologically from war. Many big-name acts are scheduled to perform including Robin Williams, Jon Stuart and Bruce Springsteen. Individual tickets have sold out, but corporate sponsor packages and VIP benefit packages are available. For more information email SUFH@remind.org.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s senior news editor.
