  <text>ASM Research Incorporated, an Accenture Federal Services Company, Fairfax, Virginia, is being awarded a $7,723,444 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to develop and map Department of Defense/Department of Veterans Affairs Joint Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System (JCCQAS). The contractor will develop a prototype to enable the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to uniformly manage credentialed healthcare providers using a single interagency system for the Defense Health Agency Defense Health Services Systems Clinical Support Division. The work to be performed includes preparing the environment for the JCCQAS application to support the JCCQAS prototype because the existing technical solution is not scalable and does not have the technical capacity to accommodate the large number of records associated with an interagency system. The Defense Health Agency, Falls Church, Virginia, is the contracting activity (HT0011-14-R-0032).</text>
