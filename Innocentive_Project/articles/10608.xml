  <text>The Air Force Space Command expects to be directed to add 1,000 new people, mainly civilians, to its base of about 6,000 cyber professionals for the 2014 fiscal year. According to the U.S. Defense Department blog “Armed With Science,” Gen. William L. Shelton, USAF, who leads Air Force Space Command, said direction for the hires would come from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, fueled by the U.S. Cyber Command. Cyber Command is in the midst of determining how it is going to operate across all the geographic combatant commands as well as those internal to the United States, Shelton said. He added that well over 1,000 people could be needed. If budget restrictions allow the increase in personnel, the new staff members will be hired over two years beginning in fiscal 2014, and 70 percent to 80 percent likely will be civilians.
