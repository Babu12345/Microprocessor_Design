  <text>The U.S. Army has awarded an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for the first mid-tier networking vehicular radios (MNVR), which will provide a link between forces at the company and platoon echelons and their higher headquarters for rapid distribution of data, imagery and other information. The Army awarded a $8.4 million delivery order to Harris Corporation for up to 232 of the multi-channel radios. These radios will be used for test, certification and integration with current and future Army vehicle platforms. The MNVR radios delivered under the contract are scheduled to undergo further testing, including a Limited User Test at the Armyâ€™s Network Integration Evaluation 15.1 in fall 2014. Other initial MNVR radios will be used for certification and integration with vehicle platforms including Strykers, Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles.</text>
