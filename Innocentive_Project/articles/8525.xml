  <text>Turn your smartphone into a scanner with the Droid Scan Pro app for Android and the DocScanner app for iPhone or Android. The Droid Scan Pro app for Android, developed by Trans-code Design, converts any snapshot into a high quality JPEG or PDF by fixing geometry, contrast and color. Use the app to scan in business cards, full-page documents, receipts and more. It also includes a built-in scan gallery to create multi-page documents and ZIP files. Depending on your needs, you can select from a variety of resolution settings: low resolution for email and high resolution for print. The app is compatible with OCR by Google Docs, Evernote and Google Goggles. You can purchase the app for $4.99 from the Amazon Appstore. In addition, the DocScanner app from Norfello Oy provides the same scanning features. It turns any document into a PDF when you snap a photo with your phone, and it can crop, sharpen and color correct the images. The app uses processing algorithms to turn and adjust the picture so it looks like a traditional scan. You can even snap pictures of meeting notes on a whiteboard and convert them to a PDF. You can purchase this app for $4.99 from the iTunes App Store or $1.99 from the Android Market.
