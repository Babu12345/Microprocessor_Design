  <text>This week marks the VA's National Salute to Veteran Patients, a celebration dedicated to expressing gratitude and respect for our nation's veterans and to encourage the public to reach out to them. It's the perfect time of year to send a card to or pay a visit to a hospitalized veteran. The VA also encourages people to learn about volunteering at its many care facilities across the nation.

To find more information about the 2012 National Salute program and how to get involved in your area, check out the website. Make a sick or wounded veteran your special Valentine!

 

 Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
