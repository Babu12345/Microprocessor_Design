  <abstract>South Korea didn't merely react when it suffered two extensive cyber attacks earlier this year. It established a national cyber policy and formed a government/military/commercial partnership to protect against future intrusions.</abstract>
  <text>South Korea has developed a national policy and program that brings government and the private sector together in a coordinated effort. This thrust, which emerged from two serious cyber attacks earlier this year, aims to have several key measures in place by 2017.
	Walter Paik, Republic of Korea consul general in Honolulu, told a panel audience at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2013 in Honolulu, Hawaii, that major cyber attacks in March and June had significant effects in the television sector and in commercial and government sites. Millions of citizens had data stolen, so the Korean government set out on a new approach.
	It defines this effort as prompt, cooperative, robust and creative—PCRC. It is a comprehensive plan in which government cooperates with the private sector. In the event of another major cyber attack, a public/private/military response team will kick in and respond.
	By 2017, Korea hopes to have a robust infrastructure in place. The number of companies that provide vital cyber information to the program will be expanded greatly. And, the government aims to have 5,000 cyber experts trained by that year.
