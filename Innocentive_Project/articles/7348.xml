  <text>BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration Incorporated, Nashua, New Hampshire, is being awarded a potential $41 million contract for four high-frequency wideband AN/SQQ-32(v)4 systems and associated engineering services and support that will detect and classify bottom and moored sea mines. The AN/SQQ-32(v)4 will be deployed from carriers for self-protection. High-frequency wideband AN/SQQ-32(v)4 will replace the in-service AN/SQQ-32(v)3 detection sonar and will improve detection performance and target resolution in high clutter environments including littoral zones and confined straits. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
