  <text>Lockheed Martin, Liverpool, New York, is being awarded a $14,949,173 contract modification for the production and support of multi-function towed arrays for the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 antisubmarine warfare combat systems. The MFTA is the next-generation passive and active sonar receiver. It affords several enhancements to the AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array System allowing greater coverage, increased capability/reliability and reduced obsolescence. Multi-function towed array significantly contributes to the capability of surface ships to detect, localize, and prosecute undersea threats and is a critical sensor to a combat systems suite. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
