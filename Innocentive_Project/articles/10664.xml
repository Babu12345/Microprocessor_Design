  <text>After service members are injured in battle, having their loved ones nearby during recovery can speed the healing process. Luke’s Wings looks to facilitate the rehabilitation by purchasing travel agency services and travel tickets for families. The end result is encouragement and motivation for everyone involved in the situation. But the organization doesn’t stop there. It also fills requests from World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War veterans in care facilities who want to see their loved ones. This Veterans in Hospice Care Program serves as a “final salute” to those who have served their country.
	The various efforts are made possible through donations from individuals and through corporate sponsorships. Information about donating is available on the organization’s website. People who need assistance can request travel funds online as well.
	Any companies that want to help have a special call to action. Currently, Luke’s Wing is running a fundraiser it calls the 50 by 5 campaign. Officials are seeking 50 businesses to make a tax-deductible contribution of $5,000 in 2013 to the nonprofit’s mission. If successful, the organization can fulfill every flight request it receives this year. Supporters will be featured on the website and in upcoming media opportunities. For more information, contact Lindsay Kin at (202) 735-5694 or lindsaykin@lukeswings.org.
	 
Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s news editor.</text>
