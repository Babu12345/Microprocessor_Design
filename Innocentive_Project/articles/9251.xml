  <text>The British Royal Marines have ordered a second contingent of Navigators, the one-man navigation and sonar reconnaissance units manufactured by Shark Marine Technologies Incorporated. Navigator applications include explosive ordnance reconnaissance to confirm the seaway to the beach is clear of obstacles and mines as well as beach reconnaissance, to ensure the beach gradient is suitable for amphibious force landing craft and the approach is clear of obstacles such as sand bars. The British Royal Marine's Navigators have been configured for use by either swimmer or inflatable raiding craft, specifically for beach reconnaissance. Data is collected and processed real-time for immediate determination as to the suitability of the beach.</text>
