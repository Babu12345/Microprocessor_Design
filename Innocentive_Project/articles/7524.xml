  <text>Cubic Applications Incorporated (CAI) has been awarded a five-year contract with a potential value close to $35 million to provide simulation and network services to support battle simulations and battle command systems for the Joint Multinational Simulation Center (JMSC) located at Grafenw√∂hr, Germany, and five other European sites. The JMSC is an element of the Joint Multinational Training Command (JMTC), the training command of U.S. Army Europe. The JMTC is the largest training command outside the continental United States. JMTC range and maneuver complexes, simulation centers, classrooms and facilities provide realistic and relevant training to U.S. Army, Joint Service, NATO, and allied units and leaders.</text>
