  <text>Scheduled to open to the public in 2015, this facility located at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, will be the U.S. Army's national landmark. The museum will feature exhibits to honor those who serve or have served in the Army, including the Reserve and National Guard; to preserve Army history; to educate the public about U.S. history; and to inspire future and current soldiers. In addition to the public access areas of the museum, plans include a Veterans Hall for use by veterans and their families; the VFW recently donated $500,000 to help construct this section. Activities in the hall will range from planned presentations to personal receptions. Lockheed Martin Corporation pledged $10 million to sponsor the Education Pavilion, a state-of-the-art interactive resource center that will feature science, technology, engineering and mathematics educational programs related to water, air, land and space.

The museum still is seeking financial support. Suggestions for how individuals, grassroots organizations, and corporate and veterans organizations can contribute are on the website of The Army Historical Foundation, which is the official lead fundraiser for the $200 million project. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
