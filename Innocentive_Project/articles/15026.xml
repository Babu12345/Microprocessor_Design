  <text>Science Applications International Corp., McLean, Virginia, is being awarded an $11,838,878 cost-plus-fixed-fee definitive contract for MH-60 weapon systems support and sustainment. The MH-60 weapon systems consist of the MH-60R and the MH-60S helicopters. The MH-60R is the Navy’s primary anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare platform and the most advanced maritime multi-mission helicopter in operation and deployed globally. The MH-60S is the Navy's maritime workhorse, performing missions from vertical replenishment to Medevac. The anticipated contract will support MH60R and MH60S helicopter production efforts. This contract combines purchases for the Navy (92 percent) and the governments of Denmark (2 percent), Australia (2 percent), Saudi Arabia (2 percent), and Brazil (2 percent) under the Foreign Military Sales program. Work will be performed in Crane, Indiana (75 percent); Indianapolis, Indiana (25 percent), and is expected to be completed by September 2017. Fiscal 2014 procurement aircraft (Navy) funds in the amount of $376,491 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S. Code 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Crane Division, Crane, Indiana, is the contracting activity (N00164-15-C-JN32).
