  <text>Lockheed Martin Canada has been awarded two contracts totaling approximately C$2 billion for the installation, integration and long-term in-service support of a new combat system for Canada's Halifax-Class frigates. The Combat Systems Integration contract will provide a new command and control system, radars, tactical data links, electronic support measures and other warfare capabilities for the Canadian Navy's 12 Halifax-class frigates. Under the terms of the contract, Lockheed Martin also will maintain the current command and control systems until the entire fleet has received the retrofit. </text>
