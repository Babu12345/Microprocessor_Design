  <text>BAE Systems will provide thermal weapon sights to the U.S. Army under a $137 million contract that continues production of the widely used infrared sensors. These second-generation thermal sights are lighter, quieter, and use less power than the first generation sights, reducing the load on soldiers and decreasing requirements for battery power.</text>
