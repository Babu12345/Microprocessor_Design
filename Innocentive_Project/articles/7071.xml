UPDATE: According to Wired.com, a Danger Room blog reader jemelehill cracked the code this afternoon. It's USCYBERCOM's mission statement translated into 32 characters with an MD5 cryptographic hash.

The new U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) logo is getting a lot of attention and not just because of its design. A golden ring around the edge features a 32-character code:

The mysterious message prompted Wired.com's Danger Room blog to hold a contest-offering a ticket to the International Spy Museum for the first person to crack it.

The only problem: even officials with USCYBERCOM don't know exactly what it means. According to Danger Room, a source with the command says it has to do with the mission statement, but he can't confirm exactly which part. Only the code's designers have the key.

Here's a look at the official USCYBERCOM mission statement:

"USCYBERCOM plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes and conducts activities to: direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks and; prepare to, and when directed, conduct full spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries."</text>
