  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems &amp; Training, Liverpool, N.Y., is being awarded a $24,462,051 fixed-price incentive, firm-fixed-price, and cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for the production and support of AN/BQS-25 low-cost conformal arrays (LCCA). The AN/BQS-25 LCCA is a passive planar array mounted on the aft submarine sail structure that is integrated with the acoustic rapid commercial-off-the-shelf insertion AN/BQQ-10 system to provide situational awareness and collision avoidance for improved tactical control in high-density environments. This contract includes options, which if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $92,476,516. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington D.C., is the contracting activity (N00024-14-C-6227).    </text>
