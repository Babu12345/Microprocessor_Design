  <text>The U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) views the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) as a key partner in its effort to secure defense cyberspace. This includes the agency having an operational mission in which it plays a critical role in defending defense cyberspace, according to the commander of CYBERCOM.
	Adm. Michael S. Rogers, USN, CYBERCOM’s commander, told the luncheon audience at the AFCEA International Cyber Symposium, being held June 24-25 in Baltimore, that his command already is planning a command and control construct in which DISA can carry out this new mission. The admiral sees DISA playing a key role as defense networking becomes more centralized.
	Part of the challenge facing that development is that DISA cannot see into individual service networks. Adm. Rogers, who is also director, National Security Agency and chief, Central Security Service, noted the current Defense Department networking construct still is aligned along service lines. He called for a global information technology backbone in which each service plugs in for the last tactical mile.
	“I’m a big proponent of the Joint Information Environment,” he declared.</text>
