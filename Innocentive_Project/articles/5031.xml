  <text>SIGNAL continues its webinar series on July 16, 2008, 12 noon ET, with Securing a Highly Available Infrastructure. The webinar will feature  William F. Clark, VP, Technical Sales and Public Sector CTO, CA, Inc., discussing how you build and operate a secure, federated, authenticated, connected world and still have a life? DoD IT organizations face an increasingly complex set of challenges around information sharing, security, SLAs, industry standards and mandates.

This Webinar will address two important and intertwined concepts:

      1. Enabling secure access to critical applications, information, and services across disparate enterprises.
      2. Providing a solid foundation for reliable federation and information exchange.

You'll hear about best practices and real-world examples from a federation expert and IT specialist who has 30 years of experience across multiple government and business sectors.
