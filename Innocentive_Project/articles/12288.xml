  <text>The U.S. Army TACOM Lifecycle Management Command has awarded General Dynamics Land Systems $72.7 million under an existing contract to upgrade 12 M1A1 Abrams tanks to the M1A2 Systems Enhancement Package (SEP) V2 configuration. The M1A2 SEP V2 includes improved color displays, day and night thermal sights, commander remote operated weapon station (CROWS II), a Thermal Management System (TMS) and a tank-infantry phone. The original multi-year contract was awarded in February 2008, which authorized the upgrade of 435 M1A1 tanks that have been in the Army’s inventory for more than 20 years. General Dynamics is continuing the conversion of the tanks in the Army’s active component to the M1A2 SEP V2 configuration.</text>
