  <text>The U.S Army is establishing the 7th Signal Command (Theater), a signal command for the continental United States (CONUS). Based at Fort Gordon, Georgia, the command reached cadre status in July and will reach initial and full operational capabilities in phased stages. The commander, Brig. Gen. Jennifer L. Napper, USA, is dual-hatted, leading the command and serving as the G-6 for Army Forces Command concurrently.

Col. Michael Kell, USA, G-3 for 7th Signal Command, explained to a track session audience here that his organization will help create centralized control in the United States for commanders looking for signal support during operations. He pointed out that the majority of troops are located within the United States, not overseas. "We are a CONUS-based Army, there's no doubt about that," he said. Part of the command's mission includes extending LandWarNet capabilites to operating and generating forces. It also will establish information managment capabilities and enable the Global Collaboration Environment.

The command will result in a restructuring of forces, with the 21st Signal Brigade scheduled to fall under its authority and the activation of the 93rd and 106th Signal Brigades at Fort Eustis, Virginia, and Fort Sam Houston, Texas. At full staffing, the 7thSignal Command Theater should employ 606 military and civilian personnel. Also unique to the command is an intelligence analysis cell within the G-2. The command will work to develop a relationship with the National Security Agency facility at Fort Gordon so the analysts can counter cyberthreats to CONUS networks.</text>
