  <text>GovLoop is a social network dedicated to connecting the government community. More than 3,200 members strong, the community's membership ranges from local and state officials to feds from a wide range of agencies.

GovLoop founder Steve Ressler created a group forum for AFCEA, which we moderate. Just a few members so far, but there are a lot of great conversations taking place there, unlike some social networks where people join but never talk.
