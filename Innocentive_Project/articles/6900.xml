  <text>The U.S. Army Applied Aviation Technology Directorate has awarded Lockheed Martin a $1.5 million contract to continue development of the Kinetic Energy Net (KEN) armor design. KEN is a modular composite armor system developed by Lockheed Martin that is lighter than current aircraft armor, but offers comparable protection. Under the contract, the company will improve the armor's performance by incorporating new forms of advanced ballistic materials and experimental strike faces.</text>
