  <text>The reality of drastically reduced defense budgets married with the rapid pace of technological development could give warfighters a tactical radio system that has more in common with consumer smartphones.

Don Woodbury, director, the Strategic Technology Office, Defense Advanced Projects Agency (DARPA) told a panel on Defense Buying Power and Research &amp; Development at the MILCOM 2011 conference that his group has been turning its science and technology prowess to projects like the "Wireless Network After Next" (WNAN).

The goal, he said, is to bring to the development of next-generation tactical radios both the business model of consumer smartphones (throw it away after two years, issue a new one) and the technology refresh of those devices (such as the improved cameras, etc. on the newest iPhones).

Woodbury told the MILCOM audience that the ultimate goal would be an interoperable tactical radio that costs about $599, utilizing commercial components and standards and modified to meet military security and field requirements.

Maj. Gen. Nick Justice, USA, Commanding General, U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, added that future infrastructure supporting command and control communications needs to have "baked in" the ability to expand and modernize to accommodate advanced capabilities not yet envisioned.</text>
