  <text>Alion Science and Technology, McLean, Virginia, was awarded a $4.5 million contract to research, develop, test and evaluate (RDT&amp;E) leading-edge technologies for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) that will bring enhanced command and control battle management to warfighters. Under the three-year Holistic Waveform Development Kit (HAWK) contract, Alion will design, develop, test and integrate services for the HAWK Advanced Waveform Development Environment Ecosystem, enabling rapid development of software-defined radio (SDR) waveforms. Alion’s work will support more flexibility for SDR systems, so that disparate radio networks can interoperate. Alion also will provide RDT&amp;E and experimentation to improve the FLEX Data Link, an architecture that simultaneously supports multiple high-speed data transmissions from radar and electronic warfare to signals intelligence. The contract runs until September 28, 2017.
