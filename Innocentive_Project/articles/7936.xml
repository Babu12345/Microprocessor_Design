  <text>Join us on April 21, 2011 at noon ET as SIGNAL Editor-in-Chief Robert K. Ackerman talks with Mercury Computer Systems' Marc Couture and Tom Roberts in "Detect, Deceive and Defeat: Increasing the HPOI of your EW System":
To detect and then locate ephemeral, shifting signals demands an advanced signal processing subsystem, combining a very High Probability of Intercept (HPOI) with a unique capability for multi-channel coherency. This webinar will present the design concepts of such a processing subsystem, with tightly integrated RF tuners and digital receivers. An open architecture helps facilitate the integration with application software. This presentation will also examine a successful case study and some newly available technologies which can enhance future subsystems.

This Webinar will provide insight on designing EW systems with:

* One to many coherent RF channels
* A High Probability of Intercept
* An open architecture addressing SWaP and cost constraints
