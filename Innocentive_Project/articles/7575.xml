  <text>The Sky Map application from Google turns Android phones into a stargazing tool with the click of a button. And a new "time travel" feature lets you see images of the sky from the past and the future. Users can identify constellations, planets, grids and deep sky objects just by holding their device towards the sky. The free app determines the locations of the planets and stars, zooms in and out, and directs users towards specific objects using a search function. The app utilizes sensors built into the device to portray a map or chart of any place the user is located without accessing the phone's camera. The latest time travel feature can show users the sky during different points in time, including what the sky looked like the day someone was born. Sky Map currently works in over a dozen languages, and more than 1,000 stars and all of the planets in our solar system are searchable and visible. The app is available in the Android app market for smart phones running Android 1.6 or newer.
