  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training, Liverpool, New York, is being awarded a $7,967,150 firm-fixed-price contract for fiscal 2015-2019 Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) Block 1B3 systems. SEWIP is an evolutionary acquisition program to upgrade the existing AN/SLQ-32(V) electronic warfare system through a modular, open-system approach. SEWIP provides enhanced shipboard electronic warfare for early detection, analysis, threat warning and protection from anti-ship missiles. SEWIP Block 1 focuses on obsolescence mitigation and special signal intercept. This contract includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $58,928,991. Work will be performed in Liverpool, New York (82 percent); and Landsdale, Pennsylvania (18 percent), and is expected to be completed by January 2017. Fiscal 2015 other procurement (Navy) and fiscal 2013 and 2014 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding in the amount of $7,967,150 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured via the Federal Business Opportunities website, with three offers received. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity (N00024-15-C-5352).</text>
