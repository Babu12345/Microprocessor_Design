  <text>SRA International Incorporated has won a re-compete task order with the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) Life Safety Security Network (LSSN) to provide enterprise management and information technology systems and communications networks integration. The contract has an estimated value of $56 million over five years if all options are exercised. SRA will continue to integrate and expand PFPA's existing LSSN so PFPA can more effectively execute its mission and operate more economically. SRA also will provide processes that span the agency's project life cycle and fully integrate help desk, infrastructure, architecture, information assurance and management tasks.</text>
