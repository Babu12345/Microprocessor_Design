  <text>The Boeing Co., St. Louis, is being awarded an $82,084,777 fixed-price-incentive-firm contract for the procurement of 12 low-rate initial production infrared search and track (IRST) systems for the F/A-18E/F aircraft. The IRST system is a long-wave infrared detection system that targets airborne vehicles in a radar-denied environment. Work will be performed in Orlando, Florida (50 percent); St. Louis (38 percent); Santa Ana, California (7 percent); and Irvine, California (5 percent). It is expected to be complete in January 2020. Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds in the amount of $82,084,777 are being obligated on this award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured pursuant to 10 U.S. Code 2304( c)(1). The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity (N00019-17-C-0026).
