  <text>U.S. veterans—on the day our nation sets aside especially for you, we at SIGNAL want to say thank you for all you’ve done overseas and domestically to make life better for everyone who lives here. From fighting vicious enemies to rescuing people during natural disasters, you step up when others run. We appreciate the sacrifice of you and your families. Welcome home.
