  <text>MTN Government Services, Leesburg, Virginia, recently announced that the company has been awarded a contract supporting the Department of Defense to provide a Re-deployable Secure Operations Center (RSOC). The MTN RSOC will be used by the DoD as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). The RSOC is a secure, self-standing rapidly deployable and re- deployable SCIF facility that can be drop-shipped into any environment and assembled within a few days. MTN will provide a turn-key, fully configured SCIF, to include all power, low-voltage and security infrastructure, requiring minimal integration by the customer. The RSOC is self-supporting and capable of withstanding multiple disassemblies and redeployments without degradation. Each procurement includes project management, equipment installation, accreditation support and testing in support of the RSOC implementation.</text>
