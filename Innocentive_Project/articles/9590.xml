  <abstract>Individual nations are entering into bilateral agreements with the Afghan government to provide various forms of in-country support for many years after their combat troops end their fight.</abstract>
  <text>Many of the nations that are helping support the Afghan people in their fight against the Taliban will continue to help the country long after their active combat has ended, according to the commander of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Gen. John R. Allen, USMC, described to the audience at Joint Warfighting 2012 how most ISAF nations are establishing their own bilateral agreements to assist the Afghan government beyond the fighting. "We will keep our commitment to the afghan national forces beyond 2014," Gen. Allen said of the planned end of ISAF combat operations. The bilateral relationships will ensure continued training, advising and mentoring of the Afghan force. Ultimately, the goal is to have the Afghan army carry out all counterinsurgency operations and allow the police to focus on traditional police issues, the general offered. "The police should be able to move from being the trailing edge of counterinsurgency to being the leading edge of law enforcement and justice," he stated.</text>
