  <abstract>The commander of the Pacific Fleet sees changes taking place far into the future.</abstract>
  <text>The strategic rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region is a long-term journey rather than a short-term effort, said the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Adm. Cecil D. Haney, USN, told the Thursday luncheon audience at TechNet Asia-Pacific, Honolulu, Hawaii, that the fleet will need several new capabilities to carry out its mission into the future.
Saying that the rebalancing has been underway and is going well, the admiral nonetheless cited the need for flexible, low-signature capabilities; the ability to operate in a degraded environment; and capabilities to better fuse, analyze and exploit larger data sets. He also called for pervasive interoperability, both internal and external; cost-effective offensive solutions; and a fire support coordination capability that integrates all fires.
	As for non-technology issues, the admiral stated that most of the fleet’s solutions involve a whole-of-government approach. The fleet works that approach accordingly, especially with international issues.
	Among the fleet’s top priorities are improving warfighter readiness; having a powerful forward presence; and strengthening relations and improving interoperability with coalition allies and partners. These efforts will help the Pacific Fleet deal with both manmade and natural disasters, the admiral offered.
