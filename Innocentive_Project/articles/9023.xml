  <text>The Defense Information Systems Agency's Global Content Delivery Service (GCDS) has introduced a cost structure for fiscal year 2012 that features a one-time fee with no recurring monthly costs. Using the GCDS saves costs, improves efficiency and offers sustainability. Rather than building and maintaining a distributed infrastructure of their own, users can take advantage of this fully operational, distributed and scalable service to lower overall operating costs and improve end-user performance. The agency recently redesigned a website that enhances GCDS solutions browsing, features a high-level description of each solution and includes simplified cost structure information. The service accelerates delivery of U.S. Defense Department Web content and applications across the nonsecure and secret Internet protocol networks.</text>
