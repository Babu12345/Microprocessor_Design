  <text>Remotec, Clinton, Tennessee, is being awarded an $8,801,324 firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for depot level repairs to the MK3 Series Remote Ordnance Neutralization Systems (RONS), and the upgrade and repair of the MK3 Mod 0 to the MK3 Mod 1 System. The MK3 Mod 1 upgrade will improve the serviceability of the robots, increase the availability of the spare parts and increase the capabilities of the robots. In situations where it is economically infeasible to upgrade or repair the MK3 Mod 0 system, the option to purchase a new RONS MK3 Mod 1 for replacement will be available under a new contract. The contract includes a one-year base period with four one-year options, which if exercised, will bring the contract value to $12,355,953. Work will be performed in Clinton, Tennessee, and is expected to be completed by August 2019. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division, Indian Head, Maryland, is the contracting activity (N00174-14-D-0027).</text>
