  <text>L-3 Communications, Link Simulation and Training, Arlington, Texas, is being awarded a maximum $469,560,000 firm-fixed-price, cost reimbursement contract for the F-16 training system (TS), aircrew and maintenance. This effort consists of contractor logistics support (CLS) and change management to include concurrency and trainer-unique changes. There are no training device purchases associated with this procurement. F-16 TS support (183 training devices) is required across 33 locations of the Air Force, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, and Pacific Air Forces; and Bahrain, Greece, and Jordan, three Foreign Military Sales countries. Training systems support (TSSC) at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, is also covered. TSSC operations include: training, system configuration control, trouble shooting, maintenance of a logistics data library, on-site engineering liaison support, feasibility studies, and modifications to visual system databases. Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity.</text>
