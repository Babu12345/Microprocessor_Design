  <text>The Missile Defense Agency is awarding Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Sensors, Moorestown, New Jersey, a contract modification with technical and schedule performance incentives for an approximate total value of $34 million for schedule and within scope adjustments to Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Baseline 4.0.1 development and multi-mission signal processor (MMSP) development under two separate contract line items. For 4.0.1, the change accounts for an initial delay in the certification schedule and an adjustment in the test plan originally contained in the 4.0.1 completion contract line item. For MMSP, the increase is associated with an extension to the development schedule to account for alignment with changes to the ACB-12 overall combat system development and integration program plan, and attributable to a delay in delivery of government furnished equipment. The Missile Defense Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
