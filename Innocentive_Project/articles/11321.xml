  <text>Summer vacations are in full swing for many, and the Stow app for iPhone can make packing much easier. Whether you're planning for a business trip, a camping excursion or even just a busy day at the office, the app helps you pick the right template and make a packing list.
	The smart travel app includes helpful features such as the "pack for weather" setting that adjusts the list of options based on what you'll need for the conditions. It also lets you share the list for multi-person trips; add and remove items with one swipe; schedule trips up to a year in advance; and email or print your lists.
	Even if you're just running out the door for work, you can save a "morning routine" template to make sure you never forget anything important.
	You can purchase the app for $1.99 from the iTunes App Store.What is your favorite travel app?These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
