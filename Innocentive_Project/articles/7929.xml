  <text>General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products, Charlotte, North Carolina, was awarded an $11 million contract modification by the U.S. Navy for the continued production of MK82 directors and MK200 director controllers for Aegis Combat System illuminators. The MK82 and MK200 are critical components of the Aegis missile fire-control system's illuminator. This award modifies a contract issued in September 2010 by the Naval Sea Systems Command. General Dynamics will install MK82 directors and MK200 director controllers aboard ships built under the restart of the DDG 51 shipbuilding program.</text>
