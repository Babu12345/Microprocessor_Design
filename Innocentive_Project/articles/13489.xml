  <abstract>Organizations cannot hope to counter cyber intruders if they don't fully understand their own network and why they are targeted.</abstract>
  <text>The key to exploiting cyber intelligence is to understand your own organization in a threat context, said panelists at the AFCEA/INSA Intelligence and National Security Summit 2014, being held September 18-19 in Washington, D.C. Government and industry must understand their cyberthreats at both the tactical and strategic levels, panelists offered.

"'Know thyself' is very important," said Lance Dubsky, chief information security officer, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Describing it as foundational, he added, "If you don't, you can't really do anything with the cyber intelligence you consume. You can't really consume, and you can't really act on that cyber intelligence."

Ron Carback, defense intelligence officer for cyber, Defense Intelligence Agency, noted that more organizations want to know why an adversary is going after them. Threat intelligence shapes the threat for decision making, he pointed out, adding that it is just as important as intrusion detection. Private companies now building analytic cells to support them in cyber, he added.</text>
