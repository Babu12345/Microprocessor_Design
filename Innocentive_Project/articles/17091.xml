  <text>The Army Cyber Center of Excellence is requesting research papers that address specific areas that answer learning demands or capability gaps that inhibit operational force effectiveness or efficiency. Among other things, the research papers will be used to evaluate emerging concepts against documented Army Signal, cyberspace and electronic warfare capability requirements.

Ideally, writers will have an interest in addressing signal, cyberspace and electromagnetic spectrum critical capability needs and may come from government solution providers, commercial vendors or academic institutions.

Six top papers will be selected by a panel of experts in the requisite areas matching paper topics. The authors will have the opportunity to present an abstract of their paper during a panel discussion during AFCEA TechNet Augusta in August. The intended audience and panel will consist of Defense Department representatives and academic and commercial community stakeholders interested in unique and innovative approaches to some of the most critical capability gaps and learning demands facing the signal, cyber and electronic warfare community.

Submissions are due June 26. For a full list of research areas of interest visit www.fbo.gov.</text>
