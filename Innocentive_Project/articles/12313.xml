  <text>Thales has signed a five-year contract with the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence to provide support for the Sonar 2050 anti-submarine sensor used on the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigate fleet. Sonar 2050 is a medium-range bow sonar currently fitted to thirteen Type 23 frigates and is the Royal Navy’s primary hull-mounted anti- submarine warfare sensor. It also provides the ship with passive detection capabilities at lower frequencies. Thales will provide physical support of Sonar 2050 for operational defect rectifications, a worldwide 24/7 helpdesk support service, dry dock and afloat support, and test equipment and handling.</text>
