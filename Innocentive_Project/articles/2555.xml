  <abstract>I am -- yet again, amazed at who I run into at various networking events.  I am tempted to go into "listen-only" mode, sometimes when I spend too much time in my cave (i.e., home office) so…  occasionally, I have to remind myself to open up a bit and talk at these events.  I usually come away with another valuable contact.  </abstract>
  <text>I am--yet again, amazed at who I run into at various networking events.  I am tempted to go into “listen-only” mode, sometimes when I spend too much time in my cave (i.e., home office) so…  occasionally, I have to remind myself to open up a bit and talk at these events.  I usually come away with another valuable contact.   There are some deep changes being contemplated in the geospatial community.  Notionally, you may already have thought it through… take all (and I mean all) of the modern features delivered to your personal communication device (iPhone, Droid, Blackberry, etc.) and apply this to the Department of Defense’s core mission, in the various nooks and crannies of the enterprise.  For now, this is as much as I will say, but it’s this kind of innovation that drives architectures, security, downlinks, databases, Web 2.0 application interfaces and obviously mobility and the infrastructure that goes with it. Thinking out of the box can be fun!  And the DoD and IC need your ideas.</text>
