  <text>You know it's coming--tax season. There's a reason I went into publishing: I'm terrible at math. So for people with poor accounting skills like me, tools like the H&amp;R Block Tax Answers app are a lifesaver. The free application offers befuddled taxpayers the chance to pose their questions to tax experts and browse others' questions, find definitions for hundreds of tax terms, determine their tax know-how by taking quizzes, and find a local H&amp;R Block office. For more information or to download the application, visit the iTunes store.
