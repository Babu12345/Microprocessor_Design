  <text>NASA has awarded a contract extension to United Space Alliance,Â Houston, Texas, to provide mission and flight crew operations support for the International Space Station and future human space exploration. The $17.4 million extension of the Integrated Mission Operations Contract covers ground-based human spaceflight operations capability development and execution. This contract includes support for mission planning and preparation, crew and flight controller training, and real-time mission execution. There is a $17.8 million option to extend the contract for another year. The total potential value of the cost-plus-award-fee contract would be $35 million, if the option is exercised. This contract extends the original contract, which was in effect from November 2008 through September 2012.</text>
