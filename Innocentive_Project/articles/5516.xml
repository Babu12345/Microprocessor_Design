  <text>CACI International Incorporated has been awarded three prime task order contracts totaling $30 million to continue the company's support for the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support System (DMLSS) at the Joint Medical Logistics Functional Development Center (JMLFDC) at Fort Detrick, Maryland. 

The Theater Enterprise-Wide Logistics (TEWLS) service access point (SAP)-based system integration contract is a three-year, $12.7 million effort to provide SAP integration of the TEWLS application, enabling it to transition into the DMLSS family of systems and to facilitate the seamless integration of the TEWLS support structure into JMLFDC.

The DMLSS Functional Sustainment Support contract, a four-year, $9.7 million effort, continues CACI's support in helping to identify the requirements for enhancing DMLSS services and provide software life cycle functional sustainment support for DMLSS applications.

The DMLSS Software Sustainment Support contract is a two-year, $7.6 million award to provide software maintenance and sustainment support for the current DMLSS Automated Information System. CACI will assist with the transformation of the current DMLSS family of applications to a net-centric services-oriented architecture system.  </text>
