  <text>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has dismissed the protest of the U.S. Navy's Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN). As a result, the original winner of the $3.5 billion contract—a consortium headed by HP—officially has won the competition.
	"HP is pleased the Government Accountability Office has upheld the Department of the Navy's award of NGEN to HP," said Marilyn Crouther, senior vice president and general manager, HP Enterprise Services U.S. Public Sector, in a statement. "HP and its world-class partners AT&amp;T, IBM, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman applaud the Navy for successfully completing the well-run Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) acquisition. The Navy has selected the right team for the challenges ahead, bringing to sailors and Marines new and innovating thinking coupled with more than a decade of experience building and operating the network.
	"Together with the Navy, the team at HP is excited to move the throttle forward on NGEN and take this network into the future," her statement concluded.
	NGEN is designed to replace the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI). Several elements, including the Marine Corps, already have begun the transition from NMCI to NGEN.</text>
