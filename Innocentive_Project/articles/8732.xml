  <text>SRI International of Menlo Park, California, is being awarded a $7,491,195 cost plus fixed fee contract to be a companion program to the existing Clean-slate design of resilient, adaptive, secure hosts (CRASH) effort. CRASH takes a clean-slate approach to limiting the vulnerabilities within each host. Modular research-based composably trustworthy mission-oriented resilient clouds is concerned with the amplifying effect of the network, seeking to turn this around and use the network as a vulnerability damper and a source of resiliency. Deliverable items include prototype software, hardware and reports. Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome New York, is the contracting activity.</text>
