  <text>Intelligent Software Solutions (ISS) has been awarded a $25 million task order by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate, for software development activities. The program involves the use of ISS' Web Enabled Temporal Analysis System Tool Kit, which enables users to process, analyze, and visualize large amounts of intelligence data from many disparate sources, in multiple form factors. The new task order will provide for software development activities associated with numerous Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security customers. These activities focus on the development of both thick client as well as rich Internet applications, and the exploration of cloud computing technologies and their utility in the Defense Department information exploitation and analysis space. The program enables ISS to continue supporting operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as on-site support at many locations around the United States and internationally.</text>
