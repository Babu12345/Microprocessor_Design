  <text>Gen. Tom Lawson, RCAF, chief of the Defence Staff, outlined four priorities for the Canadian Armed Forces in a speech last month at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. The highest priority is delivering excellence in operations. That is followed, Gen. Lawson said, by preparing the armed forces for tomorrow’s challenges, providing warfighters with training and professional development, and caring for warfighters and their families.
	Gen. Lawson acknowledged a “challenging” fiscal situation, but said, “this is an opportunity for the Canadian Armed Forces to grow even stronger, an opportunity for extra doses of innovation. It’s a chance for us to adapt, to reallocate, to transform, to focus and to allow the Canadian Armed Forces to become even more efficient while delivering success in every operation along the way.”
