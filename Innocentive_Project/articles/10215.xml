  <text>Lighten up your wallet or key ring with the new Passbook app for iOS, which allows users to store coupons, loyalty cards, movie tickets, boarding passes and more.
Passbook acts as a virtual wallet, storing important information, such as tickets and gift cards, and translating it into scannable cards or tickets in the app.
You can add “passes” to Passbook through apps, emails and websites from participating companies. So far, businesses such as Gap, Target, Walgreens, Sephora, Starbucks and Fandango have signed on to use Passbook, and the list is growing. Simply scan your iPhone or iPod Touch to check in for a flight, get into a movie and redeem a coupon.
The app comes pre-installed on the iPhone 5, and it also comes as part of the latest software update for existing iOS users.
