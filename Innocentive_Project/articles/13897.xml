  <abstract>If cyberspace is a warfighting domain, then warfighters should expect that it will not perform as desired. The same maneuver warfare skills common on the battlespace need to be applied to cyberspace.</abstract>
  <text>Being able to respond and adapt to changes in combat conditions is as important in cyberspace as it is in the battlespace. Forces must train for changes amid contested environments in cyberspace as they do in conventional battle.

This point was raised in a panel on assured interoperability on the final day of TechNet Asia-Pacific 2014, being held December 9-11 in Honolulu. Panel moderator Rear Adm. Nancy Norton, USN, J-6, U.S. Pacific Command, emphasized the need for maneuver warfare in cyberspace.

“We can’t expect our systems to be functioning as we want them to all the time,” she pointed out. They could be knocked out either from acts of nature, self-inflicted accidents or enemy action. “We must develop the skills to maneuver in this domain,” she stated.

Col. Michael Sweeney, USMC, assistant chief of staff, G-6, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said that being in an environment that is bandwidth contested and cyber denied will present challenges for the Marine Corps. “What level of risk are you willing to accept on this weapon system that is the network?” he asked. “We have to wrestle with it, just like we do with platforms such as aircraft."
