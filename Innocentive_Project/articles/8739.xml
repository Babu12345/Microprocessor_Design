  <abstract>A four-legged robot prototype designed as a pack mule for the U.S. military shows off its skills in a newly released video from Boston Dynamics. The completed robot will carry 400 pounds of payload on 20-mile missions in rough terrain. It operates without a driver, automatically traveling to designated locations using sensors and a Global Positioning System.</abstract>
  <text>Boston Dynamics posted footage on YouTube that shows early results from the development of AlphaDog-a dynamic robot developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the U.S. Marine Corps. Officially known as a Legged Squad Support System (LS3), the completed robot will carry 400 pounds of payload on 20-mile missions in rough terrain. It operates without a driver, automatically traveling to designated locations using sensors and a Global Positioning System. The video shows the robot walking over rocks, maintaining balance when pushed from the side and regaining footing after a fall.</text>
