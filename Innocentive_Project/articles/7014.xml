  <text>Readers who enjoyed SIGNAL's special supplement to its June edition honoring the Signal Corps' 150th anniversary will also want to "like" the U.S. Army Signal Regiment on Facebook to see photographs from various celebrations of the occasion as well as numerous historical photos submitted by fans.

This week, we'll be adding several sets of photographs to Flickr to join the Chief Signal Officer/Chiefs of Signal collection.</text>
