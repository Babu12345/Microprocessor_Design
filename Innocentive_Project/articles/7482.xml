  <text>A free smart phone app makes it easier for service members and veterans to track their emotional health after deployments. The National Center for Telehealth and Technology (T2), a Defense Centers of Excellence component center, developed the T2 Mood Tracker app. It helps users monitor trends of emotions and behaviors, including therapy, medication, daily experiences and changes in environment. T2 Mood Tracker can record emotional experience from a few days to several months to see results over time. That information can be shared with therapists and physicians during the patient's treatment, which is beneficial because in many cases, "research has shown that information collected after the fact, especially about mood, tends to be inaccurate," says Dr. Perry Bosmajian, a T2 psychologist. The app helps with patient recall because the user can record an experience at the time and place it happened. Users can create graphs to track medication or therapy treatment; environmental or interpersonal stressors; injuries and major life events; and much more. The app is available here for smart phones using the Android operating system. The version for the iPhone is expected to be available early next year.
