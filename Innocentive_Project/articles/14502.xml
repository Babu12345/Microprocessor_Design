  <text>The Department of Public Safety’s Fingerprint Applicant Services of Texas (FAST) program has awarded a contract to MorphoTrust USA to expand the current network of 93 enrollment facilities to include 55 new locations in more rural areas. The secure fingerprint-based background checks will be provided at IdentoGO Centers. The award makes Texas the first state to implement the company’s new commercial enrollment platform. Civilian applicants seeking licensure, employment and volunteer opportunities in Texas at agencies, including the Board of Nursing, the Department of Family and Protective Services and the Texas Education Agency, among others, can benefit from increased access. </text>
