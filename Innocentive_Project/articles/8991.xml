  <text>General Dynamics C4 Systems received a $6.5 million order from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for more than 1,000 CM-300/350 series ultrahigh frequency (UHF) Air Traffic Control (ATC) radios. This order includes the milestone 15,000th CM-300 radio delivered as part of the government's modernization program for the National Airspace System. The new order is part of a 10-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract awarded to General Dynamics by the FAA in 2002. All contract options have been exercised and the $100 million full potential value of the contract has been reached. CM-300/350 UHF radios link air traffic controllers to military aircraft flying across the national airspace. Another model of the same radio, the CM-300/350 very high frequency (VHF) radios, enable air traffic control communications for commercial and general aviation aircraft.</text>
