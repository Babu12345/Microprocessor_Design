  <text>Lockheed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems, Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded a $100,443,937 cost-plus-incentive fee and cost reimbursement modification to a previously awarded contract (N00024-15-C-6222) for procurement of Technical Insertion 16 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) systems, spares and precable kits. The A-RCI Technical Insertion 16 program provides significant improvements in acoustic performance by upgrading ship sensor processing. A-RCI is a sonar system that integrates and improves towed array, hull array, sphere array and other ship sensor processing through rapid insertion of commercial off-the-shelf-based hardware and software. Work will be performed in Manassas (95 percent) and Clearwater, Florida (5 percent), and it is expected to be completed by December 2022. Fiscal 2017 shipbuilding conversion (Navy); fiscal 2017 and 2016 other procurement (Navy); and fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funding in the amount of $100,443,937 will be obligated at the time of award, and $40,000 will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity. </text>
