  <text>The Defense Centers of Excellence (DCoE) is looking for poems to post on its blog. According to an explanatory post, "It doesn't matter if you are a service member, a loved one or a caring citizen; we want to read and share the poems you've written that express your thoughts and experiences - hardships and joys." The blog also states that "the tradition of warrior poetry is thousands of years old. For as long as wars have been fought, soldiers have expressed their feelings and experiences with poems and creative writing - a powerful outlet to help heal the invisible wounds of war and foster an unprecedented level of understanding."  Some writings already are posted to provide inspirations for burgeoning poets. Poems should be one page or less and placed in the body of an e-mail. Contact information should be included as well. Complete submission rules and the comment policy regulations are available on the website. Homefront Help has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
