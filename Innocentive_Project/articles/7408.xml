  <text>The U.S. Department of Treasury recently announced an end to the sale of paper savings bonds through employer-sponsored payroll savings programs. It's all part of a larger push by the department to save more than $400 million and 12 million pounds of paper in five years.

The department encourages participant to register for electronic savings bonds with TreasuryDirect. By opening a free account, they can set up an online savings program and purchase electronic savings bonds or other Treasury securities through direct deposit from their pay or from their checking or savings account.
