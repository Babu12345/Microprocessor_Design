  <abstract>Land, sea and air have dedicated weapons for military operations, cyber space needs them too.</abstract>
  <text>The United States may need to develop weapons for cyberspace as it does for land, sea and air, according to an industry expert. Richard Holzer, director of information assurance, Army Enterprise IT Solutions Sector, General Dynamics Information Technology, told a Wednesday morning panel audience at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2010 that the military must develop advanced cyber weapons that do not exist today. Holzer noted that many similarities exist between the cyber security world and the real world. Many of the same techniques used in battlefield management can be applied to cyberspace. However, there are differences between the two, and those differences can, and must, be exploited. A key to successful cyber operations will be the ability to develop coordinated responses. Holzer likened this to an infantry force calling in air support. New doctrines also must emerge for elements such as developing targeting information, for example. "We deploy covering fire before landing on a beach; how do we do that in cyberspace?" Holzer asked.</text>
