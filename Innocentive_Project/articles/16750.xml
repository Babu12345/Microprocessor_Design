  <text>Harris Corp., Clifton, New Jersey, is being awarded a $21,960,386 firm-fixed-price delivery order (0001) against a previously issued basic ordering agreement N00016-16-G-0003 for the development and qualification of 12 each new digital receivers and technique generator (DRTG) shop replacement assemblies (SRA) for the ALQ-214(V)4/5 on-board jammer system for the government of Australia. The DRTGs and SRAs will be used for an engineering change proposal involving both a hardware and software/firmware change to address diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages issues of the ALQ-214(V)4/F on-board jammer system. Work will be performed in Clifton, New Jersey (99 percent); and San Diego, California (1 percent), and is expected to be completed in December 2018. Foreign military sales funds in the amount $21,960,386 are being obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
