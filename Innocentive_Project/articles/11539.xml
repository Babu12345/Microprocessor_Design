James R. Clapper, director of national intelligence, revealed this week plans to form a high-level group of outside experts to examine the U.S. government's signals-intelligence collection and surveillance capabilities. The announcement follows guidance from President Barack Obama, who said new technologies that give governments unprecedented capabilities to monitor communications must be discussed. The review group will "consider how we can maintain the trust of the people," ensuring no abuse of surveillance technologies and assessing surveillance impacts on foreign policy.
	Once established, the group will brief interim findings to the president within 60 days with a final report due no later than December 15.</text>
