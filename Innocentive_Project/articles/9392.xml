  <abstract>Help Operation Gratitude help the troops by submitting the names of deployed service members who could use a touch of home and comfort. </abstract>
  <text>Operation Gratitude is one of Homefront Help's favorite organizations because of its untiring efforts to send boxes of comfort to deployed troops. Each care package includes approximately 50 snack, entertainment and hygiene items as well as personal letters of appreciation to let the recipients know they are remembered and valued. To make them feel even more special, each package is addressed to a specific individual.

That's where you come in. Operation Gratitude plans to send 100,000 boxes this year and needs names. To request packages for each person on teams of five or more, visit the Group Request Form page and follow the instructions. For individuals or groups with less than five members, fill out the Individual Request Form. Only troops who will still be deployed after July 1, 2012, are eligible to ensure that packages arrive before personnel redeploy.

Operation Gratitude is asking people to help spread the word so anyone who wants to request a package has the chance. It also offers this message to service members: "We appreciate the opportunity to express our gratitude and respect to all of you. Thank you for your courageous service to our nation and to the cause of freedom. Our thoughts and prayers are with you always."

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
