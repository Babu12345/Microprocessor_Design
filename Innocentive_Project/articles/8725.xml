  <text>DRS Technologies RSTA Incorporated, Infrared Technologies Division, Dallas, Texas, is being awarded an $11,186,684 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Low Cost Thermal Imager-Manufacturing (LCTI-M) Program seeks to provide each warfighter with the capability to detect threats and increase visibility in all weather conditions. The program aims for very low cost, low space, weight and power and room-temperature thermal cameras with state-of-the-art performance. The goal of LCTI-M is to enable widespread use and distribution of infrared cameras in military systems for each warfighter. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
