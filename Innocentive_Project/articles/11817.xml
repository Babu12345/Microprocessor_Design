  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training, Liverpool, N.Y., was awarded a potential $199,123,412 fixed-price-incentive, firm-fixed-price, and cost-plus-fixed-fee contract on Sept. 26, 2013, for the production and support of TB-37/U Multi Function Towed Arrays (MFTA) for the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Antisubmarine Warfare Combat Systems. The TB-37/U MFTA is the next generation passive and active sonar receiver. It affords several enhancements to the AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array System allowing greater coverage, increased capability/reliability, and reduced obsolescence. The TB-37/U MFTA significantly contributes to the capability of surface ships to detect, localize and prosecute undersea threats and is a critical sensor to a combat systems suite. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity (N00024-13-C-6292).</text>
