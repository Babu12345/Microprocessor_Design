The companies are each being awarded price modifications to exercise options for advanced technology products in support of the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division's Weapons Prototype Division. Products and support to be provided include electronic components and systems, mechanical components and systems, energetic materials and systems, chemical materials and components, fabrication, assembly, plating/painting/finish, and packing and shipping.Â The aggregate not-to-exceed amount for these multiple award contracts combined is a little more than $8 million, and the companies will have the opportunity to bid on each individual task order.</text>
