  <text>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) now offers an app for Apple devices that expedites the entry process for U.S. citizens and Canadian visitors into the United States. The Mobile Passport Control (MPC) app enables travelers with a smartphone or tablet to submit their passport information and customs declaration form as well as upload a self-photo prior to CBP inspection.
	Once downloaded, users create a profile that is saved on the mobile device. Prior to landing at a U.S. airport, they complete the “New Trip” section by selecting their arrival airport and airline, taking a selfie and answering custom declaration questions. Upon completion, users submit the customs declaration form and receive an e-receipt with an encrypted QR code. Arriving passengers then present their passport and mobile device to the CBP officer to finalize the inspection.
	Use at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport began today, and the program is expected to extend to more airports and to the Android platform later this year.</text>
