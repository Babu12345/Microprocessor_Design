  <text>I keep up with all things social media and Web 2.0 related by reading Mashable, one of the largest blogs focused specifically on these topics. Now fans like me can read Mashable on the go with the Mashable iPhone app. The free tool allows users to browse by channel, category, tag or author; share stories via e-mail, Twitter or Facebook; save stories to read offline later; and more. For more information or to download the application, visit the iTunes store. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new Web sites, please use proper Internet security procedures.  In other news, this is Katie Packard's last post to Cool App-titudes and SIGNAL Scape. But never fear, the blog--and the App-titude column--will continue. Future editions will include apps for other mobile platforms, Facebook, and others that catch our attention. We hope you enjoy! </text>
