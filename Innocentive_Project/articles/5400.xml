  <text>Raytheon Company has received a $17.9 million contract from the U.S. Army to develop a sensor system prototype to give helicopter crews full day or night spherical situational awareness while eliminating visual obstructions caused by the airframe and its contents. Raytheon's Advanced Distributed Aperture System is intended for rotary wing applications. The multi-sensor system and combined helmet display allow pilots to see around the cockpit and other parts of a helicopter in daylight and darkness.</text>
