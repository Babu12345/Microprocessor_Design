  <text>Applied Research Associates Incorporated, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was recently awarded a contract for more than $9 million to develop and test cost-effective intelligent systems that will address present and future humanitarian de-mining and unexploded ordinance clearance needs.Â The systems will support operations for mission planning, detection and clearance of landmines and unexploded ordnance so that indigenous citizens can safely reoccupy the land. U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command Contracting Center Washington, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, is the contracting activity.</text>
