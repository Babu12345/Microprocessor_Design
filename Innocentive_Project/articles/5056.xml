  <text>Teamspinner allows teams to create custom environments for their projects. Users can add Wiki text, lists, discussions and files. Team members can also invite others as members or observers and track any changes via RSS feeds. Users should note that this tool is currently in the beta stage. A link allows bugs and suggestions to be reported to the tool's designers.
