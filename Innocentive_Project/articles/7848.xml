  <text>General Dynamics Information Technology has been awarded a task order to support the U.S. Navy's Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division, under the SeaPort-E contract. The task order is valued at more than $41 million over five years if all options are exercised. General Dynamics will provide systems, networks, communications, and infrastructure support with help desk management for a multi-classification level Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) system. This support will include response to employees' calls, systems troubleshooting and testing, software upgrades and systems maintenance. The DJC2 provides a standardized, integrated command-and-control system to U.S. Geographic Combatant Commanders that supports Joint Task Force operations.Â General Dynamics will also manage the DJC2 operations support center, which is a collective of help desks at multiple sites. The company will provide on-site support for five worldwide combatant commander sites-San Antonio, Texas; Vicenza, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; Tampa, Florida and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii-as well as the Panama City, Florida, location.</text>
