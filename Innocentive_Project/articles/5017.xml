  <text>Warfighters on the battlefield soon will enjoy the ease of use that touchscreen computer display technology affords. A U.S. firm and a Korean firm are joining forces to manufacture and supply the U.S. Defense Department with proprietary military-grade touchscreen systems that are designed and tailored for use in harsh environments, including extreme temperatures, barometric pressure and humidity.

To create and sell the ruggedized touchscreens to the Defense Department, Woori Technology Incorporated, Seoul, South Korea, entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with MSGI Security Solutions Incorporated, New York. MSGI is purchasing components for the technology from Woori, and the two plan to open a new service facility in northern California where assembly, quality testing and systems integration will take place. The companies are scheduled to complete manufacturing of the touchscreen systems for delivery to the Defense Department later this year.</text>
