  <text>Helping troops wounded in battle is not only patriotic, it also can be a lot of fun. The Gary Sinise Foundation puts on or takes part in many events to help build the community around troops and first responders. One of its initiatives is the Building for America’s Bravest program to construct smart homes for severely wounded veterans. Gary Sinise and the Lt. Dan Band are touring in 2013 to help raise the funds necessary for the effort by selling tickets and seeking sponsorships and donation. The next concert takes place May 10 at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park in Tampa, Florida, to help Sgt. Michael Nicholson, USMC, who became a triple amputee and has traumatic brain injury after being hurt by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan.
	More concerts are scheduled throughout the year across the country. Go rock out for a great cause!
	 
Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s senior news editor.</text>
