  <text>With the Atlantic hurricane season heading into its most dangerous months, TRICARE beneficiaries have another means for keeping up with the effects to their coverage. The insurance group has created state-specific e-alerts to inform subscribers how TRICARE has been affected during and after severe weather in their areas. Customers can sign up for the notifications at www.tricare.mil/subscriptions.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNALâ€™s senior news editor.</text>
