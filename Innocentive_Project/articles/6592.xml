  <text>Alion Science and Technology has been awarded a $2.8 million contract to support an automated system used by U.S. Defense Department operations security (OPSEC) personnel to collect, analyze and collaborate on critical information, vulnerabilities and threats. Under the contract, the company will standardize OPSEC assessments and analysis to provide U.S. military forces with accurate data on their vulnerabilities to decrease their operational risk associated with information disclosure.</text>
