  <text>The U.S. Navy has awarded Lockheed Martin a $17 million contract to provide engineering design services for the MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) on the U.S. Navy's Ticonderoga class cruisers and Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers. The cost-plus-fixed fee contract combines purchases for the U.S. Navy and eight other allied navies under the Foreign Military Sales program. Included in the work is missile integration, software development, integration of the VLS into new ships, technical refresh, systems engineering and life cycle support for the MK 41 VLS.</text>
