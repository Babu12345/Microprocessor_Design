  <text>Sentinels of Freedom awards scholarships to wounded veterans-but this money does not lead to a degree. Instead, the organization provides "life scholarships" in an effort to help the injured readjust to civilian life and their new physical challenges. Through donations of time, money, goods and scholarships, veterans receive housing, transportation and employment and education assistance. They also are connected to a team of volunteers that provides guidance, mentoring and friendship during a four-year program.

The teams include up to 10 business professionals with associations relevant to the components of the program. They mobilize to carry out the Sentinels of Freedom mission in their communities, coordinating and managing donations and preparing for the veterans' arrivals, including a welcome home ceremony.

The Web site offers a wealth of information including details about sponsoring a veteran, applying for the program, donating, establishing volunteer teams, securing resources and providing on-going mentorship.

The programs listed on these pages are not affiliated with our publication or association. We highlight these independent efforts as a service to our military and our readers. For more information about these programs, please contact the organizations directly.</text>
