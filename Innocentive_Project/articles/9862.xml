  <text>The U.S. Army's System of Systems Integration Directorate (SoSI) is seeking participants for the Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 13.2 event, which is scheduled to take place at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range in May 2013. Only mature solutions that focus on SoSI-identified network gaps will be considered. Listed in the draft Sources Sought document, these gaps include commanders' applications for mobile and handheld platforms, enhanced command post collaboration and visualization, and Warfighter Integrated Network-Tactical (WIN-T) interoperable satellite communication and ground-to-ground capability on heavy brigade combat team maneuver platforms. Only solutions with a representative model or in the prototype system stage that have been tested in a relevant environment will be evaluated against a set of entrance criteria for the opportunity to participate in NIE 13.2. An updated Sources Sought will be published in August; however, SoSI officials say companies can use the draft to begin working on candidate submissions. The response deadline is August 10, 2012.
