  <text>iRobot Corporation has received an order totaling $5.8 million under its current xBot contract with the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI). This is the fifth order under the $286 million, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) xBot contract, which will deliver spare parts and accessories for iRobot's PackBot 510 with FasTac Kit.  

iRobot also has received an additional order under its current xBot contract with the PEO STRI totaling $13.3 million. This new investment marks the sixth order under the xBot contract, bringing the total contract value to approximately $63.6 million. Under this contract, iRobot will deliver 165 additional PackBot 510 with FasTac Kit robots to the Army. Developed to investigate suspicious objects, identify roadside bombs and other IEDs, as well as unexploded ordnance, the PackBot 510 with FasTac Kit easily adapts to the ever-changing requirements of bomb identification and other life-threatening missions. </text>
