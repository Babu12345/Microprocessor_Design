  <text>Ask any question, and you shall receive an answer, thanks to the free Quora app. The social question-and-answer service lets you get real replies from people with first hand experience. It puts the power of crowdsourcing in the palm of your handâ€”opening up inquires to a large community to find the best answer.
	Simply add or browse any question and find the answer from other knowledgeable users. Then vote on the best response or blog post on the topic. For example, post a question about the best restaurant for brunch in Washington, D.C., and watch answers come in from people in the area.
	The popular app has become known for its high-quality participants offering true expert opinions.
	The app is only for English-language content at this time, and Quora asks everyone to use their real full names to promote transparency.
	Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
