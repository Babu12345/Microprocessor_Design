  <text>General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc, recently received $195.5 million in funding from the U.S. Army toward an estimated $399 million contract to provide supplemental hardware and low-rate initial production of its Sky Warrior unmanned aerial system in support of the Army's Extended Range/Multi-Purpose unmanned aerial system program. Full funding is expected later this summer and will provide for 34 Sky Warrior aircraft, 16 ground control stations, airborne and ground tactical control data link equipment and various other items to include automatic landing systems, spares, and ground support equipment.</text>
