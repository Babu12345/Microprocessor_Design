  <text>Interocean American Shipping Corporation, Moorestown, New Jersey, is being awarded a potential $165,204,573 firm-fixed-price contract for the operation and maintenance of the Sea-Based X-Band Radar platform (SBX-1). SBX-1 will be deployed to the Pacific Ocean to provide ballistic missile-tracking information to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System (GMD). SBX-1 will also provide advanced target and countermeasures discrimination capability for the GMD interceptor missiles. This contract includes four one-year option periods, which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $165,204,573. Work will be performed at sea, and is expected to be completed by September 2012. The Military Sealift Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.
