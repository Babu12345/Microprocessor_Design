  <text>The Defense Information Systems Agency issued a modification to increase the ceiling value of two existing Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) multiple-award omnibus contracts for TASC-M, Andover, Massachusetts, and Interop Joint Venture II, Chantilly, Virginia. The JITC omnibus multiple-award contracts are time and material contracts that provide a full-range of test, evaluation, and certification services to support rapid acquisition and fielding of global net-centric war fighting capabilities. The total combined ceiling values will be increased by $50 million, changing the total contract ceilings from $1.155 billion to $1.205 billion. The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is the contracting activity.</text>
