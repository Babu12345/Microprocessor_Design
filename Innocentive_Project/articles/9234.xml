  <text>ITT Corporation, Electronic Systems, Radar, Reconnaissance, and Acoustic Systems, Van Nuys, California, is being awarded a $13,279,090 contract modification for AN/SPS-48G(V) radar modification kits. The AN/SPS-48 series of radars is installed on Navy ships to provide a long range, three-dimensional air picture. The modification kits will provide radar obsolescence and availability recovery addressing previously identified supportability and maintainability issues in the existing fleet population of the AN/SPS-48 onboard Navy ships. Modification kits are expected to increase operational availability and decrease operating and support costs. Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
