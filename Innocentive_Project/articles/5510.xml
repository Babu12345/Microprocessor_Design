  <text>TeleCommunication Systems Incorporated (TCS) has received additional contract funding in the amount of $17.3 million from the U.S. Marine Corps for TCS's Wireless Point-to-Point Link (WPPL) systems. The WPPL systems provide Marines with point-to-point and point-to-multipoint secure transmission of voice, video and data communications over terrestrial microwave radio links. The TCS WPPL allows communicators to extend their local area network to deployed remote locations using terrestrial microwave radio links.  </text>
