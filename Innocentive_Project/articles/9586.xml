  <text>The Jordanian government has extended its nationwide TETRA communication network contract withÂ Thales Group. In 2006, Thales was selected to supply its Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) solution, DigiMax, for the installation of a nationwide Tetra network. The national network aims to provide Jordan armed forces, public safety, police security agencies and the civil defense with a reliable, secure and easy-to-use communication system. With more than 160 base stations and 30,000 users, the fully distributed TETRA network will be in operation by the end of 2012.</text>
