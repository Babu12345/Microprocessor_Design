  <text>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker today announced that the Department of Commerce Digital Attaché Program will expand to six new markets: South Korea, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Germany and France.

In September the secretary announced the Commerce Department would double the number of global markets serviced by its Digital Attaché program. Introduced as a pilot project earlier this year, the program initially included Brazil, China, the European Union, India, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Japan. The new markets were selected based on extensive stakeholder feedback and internal evaluation to identify areas with the greatest potential to contribute to the program. 

The 12 digital trade officers are commercial officers dedicated to helping U.S. companies navigate in the global digital environment. The Digital Attaché program is part of the department’s comprehensive effort to promote the digital economy and better assist industry’s business needs. </text>
