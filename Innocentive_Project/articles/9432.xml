  <text>Just when you think Disney can't get any better, it goes and announces the Heroes Work Here initiative. Over the next three years, the company has pledged to provide at least 1,000 jobs and career opportunities for returning U.S. veterans. It also will support troops and their families as they transition to civilian life and will launch a national public awareness campaign to encourage job opportunities for veterans.

The employment offerings range from internships to leadership roles, spanning all segments of The Walt Disney Company. To recruit veterans, the corporation hosts Casting Our Veterans career expos and will participate in events showcasing jobs for returning troops. Disney also announced plans to invest in nonprofit organizations that offer training and support services for veterans.

[Active-duty personnel can enjoy Disney benefits, too. Through its Armed Forces Salute, the company offers reduced-cost theme-park tickets and hotel rooms to military families.]

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
