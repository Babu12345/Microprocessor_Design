  <text>What if you could personalize a magazine or newspaper so it contained only the news, photos, updates and information you wanted to receive? Meet Flipboard-a free app for the iPad that takes the news you care about online and puts it into one convenient place.

The Flipboard app is a fast and visual way to view news and social media sites. You select the information you want to see, and the app presents it like a print publication. Simply flag content from Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, websites and more, and see it all in one place. It can be entirely customized, and it allows you to share, like, retweet, hide and email any posts or stories. Simply flip through the pages with the swipe of your finger.

Flipboard has a 5-star rating out of nearly 9,000 reviews. You can download it in the iTunes App Store.
