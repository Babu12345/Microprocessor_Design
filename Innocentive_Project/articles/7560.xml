  <text>An app created by the wife of a U.S. Marine provides handy tools to help military spouses cope with deployment stress. Compatible with the iPhone or iPod Touch, the Military Wife Deployment Survival Guide app by iCrysta features seven different sections with unique tools. Users can set a countdown clock that automatically tracks how long until their spouse returns. They also can post and share pictures of their spouse on a virtual corkboard. The app provides world clocks, which the user can set to track what time it is where their spouse is deployed. It can even show several time zones for people who are traveling. Other sections of the app provide motivational messages, calming quotes and virtual surprise gifts to brighten the day. In addition, users can record their spouse's voice and play it while they are deployed. The app is available for $1.99 in the iTunes App Store.
