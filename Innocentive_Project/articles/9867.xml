  <text>A new app from the Defense Department could help military members and their families tackle the mental health challenges they face in everyday life. The free LifeArmor app, available for iOS and Android, covers a variety of behavior topics with information, assessments and videos of personal stories, and it develops coping skills through interactive exercises. Developed by the National Center for Telehealth and Technology, the program aims to assist members of the military community as they deal with common mental health concerns. It's a companion app for the afterdeployment.org website, which launched in 2008. Behavior topics covered by the app include alcohol and drugs, anger, anxiety, depression, stress, sexual trauma, sleep issues, spirituality, work adjustment and more. Download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play. These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
