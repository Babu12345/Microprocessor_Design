  <text>The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), Laurel, Md., is being awarded a five-year, sole source, cost-plus-fixed-fee, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, task order contract for research, development, engineering, and test and evaluation for programs throughout the Defense Department. The maximum ceiling amount is $2,296,583,964 for up to 11,964,743 staff hours of research and development in the core competency areas approved for JHU/APL by the department, which include: strategic systems test and evaluation; submarine security and survivability; space science and engineering; combat systems and guided missiles; theater air defense and power projection; and information technology; simulation, modeling, and operations analysis. This contract includes an option for an additional five years, which requires separate review and approval by assistant secretary of the Navy (research development and acquisition) and assistant secretary of defense (research and evaluation), which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative maximum ceiling value of the contract to $4,904,853,263 for up to 23,929,486 staff hours. Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity on behalf of the Defense Department.</text>
