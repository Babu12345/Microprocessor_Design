  <abstract>The move to the cloud offers great potential for U.S. Navy information technology efforts. Yet, other aspects such as applications and integrated capability sets must work their way into the sea service cyber realm.</abstract>
  <text>The move to the cloud that is gripping all elements of government and industry offers great potential for the U.S. Navy, according to its chief information officer. Terry Halvorsen told the breakfast audience on the final day of TechNet Asia-Pacific 2013 in Honolulu, Hawaii, that the move to the cloud is one of the best areas for gaining effect in Navy information technology.
	However, other elements must fall into place for this move to be successful. Halvorsen said it must be but it must be coupled “with how you look at and structure applications,” adding the Navy has too many applications.
	He continued that the Navy must look at the true value of data. And, it should look at other efficiencies, including data storage.
	Halvorsen called for industry to work with the Navy on these efforts, the success of which would benefit both. “Bring us the integrated sets of capabilities that we need, particularly in the business area, for the lowest cost,” he said, directing his remarks to industry. “It is the business side where I will take the greatest amount of risk,” in contrast to the warfighter realm, he emphasized.
