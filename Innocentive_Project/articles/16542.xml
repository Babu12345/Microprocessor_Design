  <text>Foster Miller Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, is being awarded a $10,253,933 firm-fixed price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for Man Transportable Robotic System MK 2 post-production support. This contract includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $31,694,088. Work will be performed in Waltham, Massachusetts, and is expected to be completed by August 2017. If all options are exercised, work will continue through August 2019. Fiscal 2016 operation and maintenance (Navy) funding in the amount of $50,000 will be obligated at time of award, and will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured in accordance with 10 U.S. Code 2304(c)(1). Foster Miller Inc. is the only company that has the ability to provide post production support for the Man Transportable Robotic System (MTRS) MK 2 because the government has limited and restricted data rights, and does not own the technical data package in full for the MTRS MK 2. Foster Miller owns all data rights to the MTRS MK 2. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division, Indian Head, Maryland, is the contracting activity (N00174-16-D-0001).</text>
