  <text>Operation Gratitude supports deployed warfighters by working to provide them with care packages and letters from groups and individuals back home. It sets itself apart from similar organizations by also bringing items to troops undergoing long-term rehabilitation at several military hospitals. To further the physical and mental well being of these warfighters, Operation Gratitude offers a service in which it sends packages from the injured to their unit members on the front lines. This has a two-fold result: those deployed know their wounded comrade is thinking about them, and the patients still feel they are contributing to the battlefield. The nonprofit offers several suggestions for groups, including Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops, and individuals who want to support the efforts. These ideas include long-term and one-time participation options. The organization also encourages any service member or unit who would like to receive packages or letters to sign up through the website. Other reasons to visit the site include the chance to read messages of thanks from troops who have benefited from the donations and access to the online store. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
