  <text>The Department of Defense yesterday launched the Open Government  Plan, its latest salvo aimed at increasing transparency and opportunities for engagement and collaboration. From Elizabeth McGrath, DoD Assistant Deputy Chief Management Officer:
In the four months since the Office of Management and Budget issued an  Open Government Directive, the Department of Defense has demonstrated  its commitment to improve transparency, participation and  collaboration.  Improved transparency can enable the public to better  understand goals and activities of the Department and facilitate  analysis of data never before shared publicly.  Broader participation  can serve to lower barriers between the Federal Government and public  citizens.  Finally, greater collaboration can foster an open exchange of  ideas between federal employees, public interest groups and the  interagency community to maximize creation of best practices and new  initiatives.  Embracing Open Government at the Department of Defense  will generate new ideas benefiting both the Warfighter and U.S.  citizens.
Interested parties are invited to visit the DoD Open Government site, created in February, and provide feedback on the plan at the OpenDefense discussion forum.
