  <text>Do you travel frequently for business? The free Concur app could help you manage all your travel-related plans and expenses.
	Book airfare and hotels; manage flight and car itineraries; check flight status; approve travel requests; and change or cancel reservations. While you're away, track business expenses and receipts. View credit card transactions and add them to expense reports, upload receipts with your camera phone and submit expense reports on the go. Those with manager access also can approve or reject expense reports and invoices.
	The app is available for Apple, Android and BlackBerry.?
