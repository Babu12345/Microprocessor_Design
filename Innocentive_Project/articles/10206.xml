  <text>Elbit Systems Ltd., Haifa, Israel, was awarded a contract from the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for the supply of Battle Management Systems (BMS) for the Royal Australian Navy's landing craft. The contract is in an amount that is not material to Elbit Systems. The systems are to be integrated into landing craft installed on board the Canberra Class Amphibious ships (LHD). The watercraft will enable transport of troops and equipment from the LHDs to the shore including where there are no fixed port facilities and will allow communication and connectivity with the Infantry Forces in joint operations.</text>
