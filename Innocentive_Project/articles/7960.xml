  <text>Business on the move-instantly accept credit cards with the Square app for iPhone. Forget about operating bulky registers, counting coins or writing checks. The Square app, developed by Square Inc., allows individuals and businesses to accept credit card payments using an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Every app user receives a free Square credit card reader in the mail that attaches to their smartphone to process the transactions. It doesn't require a contract, monthly fee or merchant account. The app tracks sales, tips, tax and sends electronic receipts. It meets all the industry standard security practices to ensure safety and accepts all major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. The Square app is free from the iTunes app store.  These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
