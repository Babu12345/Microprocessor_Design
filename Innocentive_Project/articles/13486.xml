  <abstract>The first U.S. national intelligence strategy in five years is released exclusively in unclassified form.</abstract>
  <text>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) today released its 2014 National Intelligence Strategy of the United States of America in one version only—unclassified. James R. Clapper, U.S. director of national intelligence (DNI), rolled out the new strategy in his address to the opening plenary session at the AFCEA/INSA Intelligence and National Security Summit 2014, being held September 18-19 in Washington, D.C.

Clapper declared that he signed only one version of this strategy—an unclassified one. Putting the strategy out to the public, without publishing a classified version, emphasizes the transparency approach his office is taking.  Clapper lauded transparency, but he also warned that a downside of that approach is that it also shows information to adversaries. “No one else does that except us,” he maintained.

The new strategy outlines four major components: strategic environment, mission objective, enterprise objective and implementing the strategy. It is available on the DNI website at www.dni.gov/files/documents/2014_NIS_Publication.pdf.</text>
