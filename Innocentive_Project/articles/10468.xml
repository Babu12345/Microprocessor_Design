  <text>The U.S. Navy has given the go ahead for the first shipboard installation of a new tactical communications network designed to replace multiple networks now found on warships. The Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services (CANES) combines five legacy networks into one integrated network. The first CANES installation will take place onboard the San Diego-based destroyer USS Milius (DDG 69), and the Milestone C acquisition memorandum calls for an initial fielding of 29 CANES units within 23 installations. The system underwent operational tests last September. Eventually, CANES is expected to be deployed on the Navy's fleet of 190 ships and submarines as well as Maritime Operations Centers by 2020.
