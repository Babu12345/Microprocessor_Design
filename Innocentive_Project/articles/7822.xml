  <text>Integral Systems Incorporated, Colorado Spings, Colorado, was recently awarded by the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center a more than $13 million contract modification to its Command and Control System-Consolidated contract. Under the terms of the contract modification, Integral Systems will continue to provide its EPOCH Integrated Product Suite to simplify operations by consolidating satellite ground systems. The contract, first awarded in early 2002, enables a unified command and control capability for the 50th Space Wing's complete family of military communications satellite programs.</text>
