  <text>Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, St. Petersburg Fla., was awarded a $32,832,550 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract (N00024-13-C-5212) for Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) design agent and engineering services. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. This contract includes options, which if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of this contract to $236,663,164. Raytheon Network Centric Systems, Largo, Fla., was awarded a $7,307,299 cost-plus-incentive-fee, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract (N00024-13-C-5230) for Cooperative Engagement Capability Common Array Block (CAB) family of antennas. This contract includes a system requirements review/system functional review; a preliminary design review; and a critical design review and initial production of two versions of the CAB antenna. The CAB-Surface will be utilized on surface ships and the CAB Expeditionary will be utilized for U.S. Marine Corps Composite Tracking Network. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity for both awards.Â </text>
