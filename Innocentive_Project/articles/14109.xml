  <text>The U.S. military must upgrade or replace aging equipment just as it faces new challenges that require revised force priorities, according to the commanding general of the U.S. Northern Command. Adm. William E. Gortney, USN, who also is the commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, described these challenges in his address to the Tuesday luncheon audience at West 2015, being held in San Diego, February 10-12.

The best part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent is its ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) force, Adm. Gortney offered. Yet, the entire SSBN force must be recapitalized. Threats to U.S. space services also have increased. The admiral added, “We took our eye off the ball on [command and control]. We’re shoring that up.”

Adm. Gortney noted that China is the only power that is able to hold a fight against the U.S. Navy. The United States conducts exercises with the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which works strongly to U.S. benefit. These exercises allow U.S. forces to learn about the PLAN, and it helps PLAN personnel learn not to believe their own media stories about how they will defeat U.S. forces, he offered.

The admiral maintained that the U.S. military services must be sized correctly for today’s missions with adequate resources. Yet, the services also must discard obsolete capabilities while eliminating waste, he added.</text>
