  <text>The U.S. Air Force may be the newest military branch, but it has had a public museum dedicated to its achievements since 1955. In addition to the regular exhibits highlighting the history and accomplishments of airmen, the museum restores aircraft and aerospace vehicles with historical accuracy. As with the facilities dedicated to the other armed services, admission is free and the museum is open most days of the year. People interested in the history but unable to make the trip to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, can take a virtual, 3-D, self-guided tour online. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
