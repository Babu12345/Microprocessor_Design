  <text>The shopping season is upon us, and buying gifts for others could translate into treats for yourself with the ShopKick app for iOS and Android.
This free program gives you rewards for shoppingâ€”even if you don't buy anything. Simply walk into a store like Target, Best Buy or Old Navy and get "kicks" you can redeem for rewards. You can get even more kicks if you scan items or make a purchase.
	Treats include a free coffee at Starbucks, gift cards, iTunes song downloads and more.
	Download ShopKick from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered. When visiting new websites, please use proper Internet security procedures.</text>
