  <text>The Federal Aviation Administration has announced the six unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) sites available for conducting operations research and testing. Test site operators will perform their research at the University of Alaska; Griffiss International Airport, New York; Texas A&amp;M University; and Virginia Tech, as well as in the states of Nevada and North Dakota. Investigations will include system safety and data gathering; aircraft certification; command and control link issues; control station layout and certification; ground and airborne sense and avoid capabilities; and environmental impacts. Each test site operator will manage the locations in a way that allows access to parties interested in using them.
	The sites were chosen from 25 proposals that were received from 24 states. Test site operations will continue at least through February 13, 2017.</text>
