  <abstract>Controlling an anti-missile system? There's an app for that. A mobile program developed for the U.S. military serves as a refresher tool for troops assigned to the Patriot anti-missile system.</abstract>
  <text>A new iPhone app has been designed to help troops stay up to speed on the Patriot anti-missile system, but users won't find this program in the iTunes App Store-it's by invitation only. Made strictly for the military and containing detailed information on the major defense system, the Raytheon Company-developed Patriot Crew Drill app is a multiple-choice game aimed at helping troops on the front lines of Iraq and Afghanistan who, in peacetime, would be dedicated to operating the Patriot anti-missile system. Many soldiers go for months or even a year without operating the system, and the game serves as a refresher and a way to stay sharp. The app runs a soldier through the steps they must go through to assemble and set up the Patriot anti-missile system. It presents the user with a scenario and three multiple-choice questions. Answer successfully and move on in the game. Fail the test and feel the wrath of a virtual staff sergeant. Raytheon said in a statement it intends to launch a number of iPhone military apps in the future.
