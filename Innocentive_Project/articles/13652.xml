  <text>Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Inc., San Diego, has announced that it has received an option award valued at $2.2 million to supply AN/ARA-63 Tactical Instrument Landing Systems (TILS) for both the F/A-18E/F/G and E-2D Naval aircraft. The award is an extension to a two-year requirements contract issued by the U.S. Navy. The AN/ARA-63 TILS is a microwave landing system that provides precise elevation and azimuth guidance information necessary for critical aircraft carrier landings. The TILS began as an initial multiyear contract for the F/A-18E/F Boeing Super Hornet and was expanded to cover the E/A-18G Growler jammer aircraft and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye radar surveillance aircraft.
