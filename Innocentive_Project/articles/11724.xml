  <text>The U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) has signed a Co-operative Research &amp; Development Agreement (CRADA) with Locata Corporation, Canberra, Australia, to build and demonstrate new Locata technology for use in GPS receivers. The CRADA is specifically directed to evaluate Locata’s patented Vray switching antenna and new correlator technologies for multipath mitigation in position receivers that run at GPS frequencies. AFIT will first design and build a GPS-frequency multi-element switching antenna prototype that is based on Locata Vray patents. When built, AFIT intends to use their GPS receiver and this prototype Vray to physically demonstrate the feasibility of using Locata technology to improve GPS receiver performance.</text>
