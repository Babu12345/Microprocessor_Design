  <text>Lockheed Martin Corp., Mission Systems and Training, Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded a $13,864,676 cost-plus-incentive-fee contract modification to previously awarded contract N00024-11-C-6294 for the Acoustic Rapid Commercial-Off-The-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) production, and provides funding for the development and production of the A-RCI and common acoustics processing for Technology Insertion 14 (TI14) for the U.S. submarine fleet. A-RCI is a sonar system that integrates and improves towed array, hull array, sphere array and other ship sensor processing through rapid insertion of commercial-off-the-shelf-based hardware and software. This modification will purchase TI14 upgrades. Work will be performed in Manassas, Virginia (70 percent); and Clearwater, Florida (30 percent), and is expected to be complete by September 2019. Fiscal 2016 other procurement (Navy) funding in the amount of $13,864,676 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
