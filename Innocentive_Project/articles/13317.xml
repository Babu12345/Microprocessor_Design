  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training, Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded a not-to-exceed $59,728,305 modification to a previously awarded contract (N00024-13-C-5225) for the Navy's fiscal 2014 AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) System and shore site development systems. The AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 is a USW combat system with the capabilities to search, detect, classify, localize and track undersea contacts, and to engage and evade submarines, mine-like small objects and torpedo threats. The contract is for development and production of the Technical Insertion 14 baseline of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 USW systems. This contract combines purchases for the U.S. Navy and the government of Japan (25.4 percent) under the Foreign Military Sales Program. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
