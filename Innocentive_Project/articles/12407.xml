  <text>Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, Portsmouth, R.I., is being awarded a potential $199,692,601 fixed-price-incentive contract for the purchase of three AN/AQS-20A sonar, mine detecting sets with ancillary equipment. The AN/AQS-20A sonar, mine detecting set is a mine hunting and identification system with acoustic and identification sensors housed in an underwater towed body. The acoustic sensors are designed for the detection, classification and localization of bottom, close-tethered, and volume targets in a single pass. The identification sensor is designed for the identification of bottom mines. The system will be deployed from the Littoral Combat Ship as part of the Mine Countermeasures Mission Package. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity (N00024-14-C-6302).</text>
