  <text>The earthquake that hit Los Angeles this week gave many on the West Coast a rude awakening. While the quake caused minimal damage, it served as a good reminder to prepare your family or home as much as possible for a natural disaster.
	The free Earthquake app by the American Red Cross provides step-by-step instructions for what to do before, during and after an earthquake, even if the power is out or you don't have data connectivity. The app sends alerts and notifications generated by the U.S. Geological Survey when an earthquake occurs along with the perceived shaking impact for specific areas. You also can send customizable "I'm Safe" alerts on Facebook, Twitter, email and text. Plus, find open Red Cross shelters in your area; use the Toolkit for a strobe light, flashlight and audible alert; learn how to prepare an emergency kit; and know what to do about food and drinking water in areas with power outages.Download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.These sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
