  <text>Many people received cellphones, video games, computers and a wide variety of electronic devices during the holidays. Rather than stockpile your old electronics, consider donating them to benefit the AFCEA Educational Foundation. Not only is this an easy way to clear your e-clutter, but you also can reap a tax benefit. 

Our recycling process is worry-free. All personal data on your devices will be erased using state-of-the-art technology. We also cover the cost of shipping your old gadgets. Simply go to https://afcea.causenetwork.com/offers/upcycle, fill out the form, and you will receive a shipping label. 

When your device is resold, you will receive a receipt to claim your deduction, and the foundation will receive a donation.

All funds from our e-recycling program will go directly to support the Educational Foundation’s Gravely Grants, which aid K-12 classroom science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs.
