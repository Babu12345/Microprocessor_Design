  <text>Extensions for the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) multiple-award Omnibus contracts were issued as a modification to each of the three existing contracts: TASC-M and TASC-N, both in Andover, Massachusetts; and Interop Joint Venture II, Chantilly, Virginia. The three JITC Omnibus multiple-award contracts are time-and-material contracts that provide a full-range of test, evaluation, and certification services to support rapid acquisition and fielding of global net-centric war fighting capabilities. The extensions will add an additional six-month period to each JITC Omnibus contract. The total combined ceiling values for the extension period will be increased by $35 million, changing the total contract ceilings from $1.219 millionÂ to $1.254 million.The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, is the contracting activity.</text>
