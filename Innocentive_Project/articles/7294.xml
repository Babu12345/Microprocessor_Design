  <text>General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products has been awarded a potential $300 million contract by the U.S. Army for production and field support of Joint Biological Point Detection Systems (JBPDS). The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Acquisition Center, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, awarded the contract. The JBPDS is a self-contained instrument suite that rapidly detects and identifies biological warfare agents. Available in man-portable, shelter-based, ship-based and trailer-mounted variants, the JBPDS can be configured to meet the operational requirements of the U.S. Army and Navy.</text>
