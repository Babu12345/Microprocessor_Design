  <text>The U.S. Missile Defense Agency has awarded Northrop Grumman Corporation a $90 million task order under the agency's Joint National Integration Research and Development Contract to further develop and evaluate Enhanced Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications capabilities. These capabilities will enable the implementation of the agency's Phased Adaptive Approach for more timely, affordable and responsive missile defenses to protect against ballistic missiles of all ranges and increasing raid sizes.</text>
