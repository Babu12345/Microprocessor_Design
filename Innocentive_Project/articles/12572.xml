  <text>Guam MACC Builders A Joint Venture, Honolulu, Hawaii, is being awarded $45,450,600 for firm-fixed-price task order 0003 under a previously awarded multiple award construction contract (N62742-10-D-1309) for the design and construction of a high bay maintenance hangar to support forward operations and maintenance functions for the unmanned aircraft system MQ-4C Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) platform at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The MQ-4C requires interior and enclosed maintenance space to accomplish scheduled inspections, airframe repairs, pre- and post-flight operations, as well as technical order compliance and aircraft modifications. The task order also contains two unexercised options, which if exercised would increase cumulative task order value to $46,719,102. Work will be performed in Yigo, Guam, and is expected to be completed by April 2016. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, is the contracting activity.</text>
