  <text>Silvus Technologies Inc., Los Angeles, Calif. has been awarded a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency contract for the 100 Gigabits per second (Gb/s) Radio Frequency (RF) Backbone (100G) program. The total dollar value of this 20 month Phase I contract is approximately $3.7 million. As a final deliverable of this phase, Silvus is to demonstrate a multiple input, multiple output system capable of multiplexing eight independent streams, each carrying one Gb/s data over a line-of-sight wireless range above 50 kilometers. The goal of the 100G program is to design, build and test an airborne-based communications link with fiber-optic-equivalent capacity and long reach that can propagate through clouds and provide high availability. The system will provide 100 Gb/s capacity at ranges of 200 kilometers for air-to-air links and 100 kilometers for air-to-ground links from a high-altitude (e.g. 60,000 ft.) aerial platform. Additionally, the system will provide an all-weather, including cloud, rain, and fog, capability while maintaining tactically-relevant throughput and link ranges.</text>
