	Booz Allen Hamilton's chairman and CEO Dr. Ralph Shrader

Dr. Ralph Shrader's speech was the last of this blogger's coverage of events at WEST 2010. It was well worth the wait. Shrader's focus was on leadership and its importance to a successful future. Unlike characters in science fiction tomes, today's leaders do not have the advantage of traveling to the past to change decisions that led to trouble in the future. Instead, they must be forward thinking enough to predict the future and take control of their organizations lest the future decide their fortune...or lack thereof. Experience is necessary but optimism is critical, he emphasized. And he redefined the term experience, saying that it was not accumulated years in a particular field but rather the accumulated of knowledge gained and shared during that time. In addition, let's face it the future is unknown and scary for most of us. A good leader realizes this and must show confidence and enthusiasm about future success. It's been a true honor sharing my take on some of the events at WEST 2010 with you. So comment on what you've read (which shows me you're reading it!) and let AFCEA and USNI know where they got it right with this conference and where they could have made it better.
