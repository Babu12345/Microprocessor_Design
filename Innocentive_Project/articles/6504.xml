  <text>The U.S. Coast Guard's Deepwater program has a new name and already is generating results for Coast Guard personnel. Now known as the Coast Guard Acquisition Program, the troubled effort is generating positive results, according to Rear Adm. Manson Brown, USCG, commander, 14th Coast Guard District. Responding to an audience question after his luncheon and keynote address at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2009, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, November 2-5, Adm. Brown stated that the program is necessary for replacing old equipment that may not be capable of meeting the new demands facing the Coast Guard. Among the success stories are re-engineered helicopters that have enabled Coast Guard personnel to make dozens of rescues, the admiral pointed out.</text>
