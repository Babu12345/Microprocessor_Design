  <text>Lockheed Martin Corp., Orlando, Florida, was awarded a $7,832,701 modification (P00022) to contract W900KK-14-C-0020 to accommodate increased demand for cyber training and test event operations at the national cyber range which is operated and sustained by Lockheed Martin. The increased levels of support will provide the ability to scale up technical capacity and to support the increased tempo of cyber event operations. Work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, with an estimated completion date of May 25, 2019. Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $5,309,700 were obligated at the time of the award.
