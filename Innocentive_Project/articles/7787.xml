  <text>The U.S. Navy awarded several billion dollars in contracts to four companies, including Serco Incorporated, Reston, Virginia; VT Milcom, Virginia Beach, Virginia; Lockheed Martin Services Incorporated, Gaithersburg, Maryland; and AMSEC Limited Liability Company, Virginia Beach, Virginia. Contracts are for the installation and operational certification of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Centers for Program Executive Office (C4I &amp; Space), Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and other prospective U.S. Government and Foreign Military Sales customers. The C4ISR systems are produced under various production contracts-separate from these four contracts-and are delivered as government-furnished equipment to this contract for installation onboard surface ships, submarines, and shore stations located worldwide. The potential contract values are: Serco, $1.4 billion; VT Milcom, $1.38 million; Lockheed Martin, $1.37 billion; and Amsec, $1.31 billion. These four contractors may compete for task orders under the terms and conditions of the awarded contract. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, California, is the contracting activity.</text>
