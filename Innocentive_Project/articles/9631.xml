  <text>Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems, Portsmouth, Rhode Island, is being awarded a $12,218,916 firm-fixed-price delivery order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement for specialized test equipment and "golden units" necessary to perform depot-level repairs to identified airborne low frequency sonar components in support of the MH-60 aircraft. This effort is targeted to augment the original equipment manufacturer repair capacity, reduce turnaround time, and improve fleet support. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
