  <text>Data Upgrades for Old WarbirdsThe U.S. Air Force’s venerable fleet of B-52 Stratofortress bombers is joining the network-centric force. They are being outfitted with the Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) system, which will provide the aircraft with enhanced situational awareness and mission flexibility. The CONECT modification involves the installation of a digital communications infrastructure into the B-52 that enables the aircraft to link to the Air Force’s digital communications network and contact command and control centers, ground forces and other platforms. The first aircraft to receive the equipment is undergoing fight tests. All 76 aircraft in the fleet will receive CONECT after the flight test program is complete. Multinational Maritime Security Experiments UnderwayTrident Warrior 09 (TW09) and the associated Operational Level Command and Control (OLC2) experiments officially begin today. Among the issues the events are examining are maritime situational awareness, information operations, sea basing and collaboration between maritime operation centers. The annual FORCEnet sea trial examines technologies and refines, develops, tests and explores capabilities to close gaps between maritime operations centers’ core operational level of command and control. This is the first time the OLC2 is being integrated within the Trident Warrior construct. The two experiments currently underway are the third in a spiral process.NSPS Review Group Announces Public MeetingsThe Defense Business Board task group created to review the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) will hold public meetings at the Hyatt-Arlington in Arlington, Virginia. The first is scheduled for June 25 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; the second on June 26 from 9 a.m. to noon, resuming from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The group will invite experts who have testified before Congress on the NSPS to the first event and will listen to select members of the public for additional information about previously submitted written comments at the second. The public can attend and provide comments until June 26, but those received after June 18 may not arrive in time for consideration. Royal Navy Answers Siren CallBritish Royal Navy submarines recently demonstrated the ability to communicate in real time while submerged and at depth. The vessels tested the Deep Siren Tactical Paging (DSTP) system, which consists of expendable buoys that link to the Iridium satellite network and allow long-range underwater communications through acoustic signals. The trial validated that the DSTP, which was developed by an industry team that includes the Raytheon Company, can communicate with submerged submarines at ranges in excess of 100 nautical miles. The U.S. Navy successfully tested the technology in 2008. Service Halts ExpansionThe U.S. Army has cancelled its plan to build three additional brigade combat teams (BCTs). As a result of the decision, the Army will be able to maximize its ability to deploy brigades for contingency operations and major exercises; to take advantage of access to training facilities, battle command centers and training support centers; and to improve quality of life for troops. The decision does not affect the restationing of the two heavy BCTs, which are scheduled to return from Europe in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, an action that is being examined as part of the Quadrennial Defense Review. Army officials say the service still will reach its target of 45 BCTs in fiscal year 2010. The teams were scheduled to be located at Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Carson, Colorado; and Fort Stewart, Georgia.German Forces Acquire Advanced RadarThe German Federal Office of Defence Technology and Procurement has accepted for evaluation two system demonstrators of BodenÃ¼berwachungsradar (BÃœR), a ground surveillance radar that precisely detects ground and low-altitude movements. Developer EADS Defence and Security will begin delivering approximately 80 systems in 2012. The radar should close the German Armed Forces’ gap in capabilities in intelligence gathering and reconnaissance. The BÃœR can perform multiple reconnaissance tasks simultaneously, and each can assume the work of several conventional radars. A modified version of the radar is under development for civil applications. BÃœR is suitable for mobile use on the DINGO 2 armored vehicle.DHS Tests Biometric Exit ProceduresThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has implemented biometric exit procedure tests at Hartsfield-JacksonAtlantaInternationalAirport and DetroitMetropolitanWayneCountyAirport as part of the US-VISIT program. Within the next year, the DHS will begin implementing the procedures at other locations. Officials are collecting digital fingerprints from non-U.S. citizens departing the country at these locations as part of a pilot program. Since 2004, the United States has collected biometrics from most foreign citizens applying for visas or arriving at U.S. ports of entry. US-VISIT simultaneously has worked to create the automated biometric exit capability. Contract Associated With Presidential Helicopter CancelledFollowing the U.S. Defense Department’s decision to cancel the presidential helicopter replacement program last month, the U.S. Navy is terminating the VH-71 system development and demonstration (SDD) program contract. Initial plans called for the VH-71 to replace both the VH-3D and VH-60N aircraft, which currently conduct presidential support missions. According to the Defense Department, the Navy’s contract and associated work with Lockheed Martin Systems Integration–Owego for the SDD was terminated for the convenience of the government. Visa System Undergoes OverhaulThe visa processing system for the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs is being streamlined. Existing legacy visa software will be consolidated into one processing system that features a new integrated suite of applications. The system aims at lowering risk, cost and complexity while enhancing productivity, accountability and security. In addition, it focuses on improving visa operations domestically and at international embassies, and it allows for the flexibility that is needed to meet new legislative mandates efficiently. New Standard for Federal Records ManagementA new guideline for government records management will enable organizations to better meet federal data record keeping requirements. The Records Management Services (RMS) Technical Specification is a new global standard that ensures federal agencies can fulfill their obligations in the areas of federal records management, open government and transparency. The RMS involves the reuse of enterprise Web services that can address the full record life cycle from creation through archiving. It will be the basis for the first U.S. governmentwide specification for records management services meeting the requirements of the Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office.  News Briefs Archives</text>
