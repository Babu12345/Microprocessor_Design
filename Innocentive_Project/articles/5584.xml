  <text>Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $16.9 million contract to begin modernization of the final portion of the U.S. Army's Apache helicopter Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight system. Under the contract, Lockheed Martin will modernize the Laser Transceiver Unit in the Apache's legacy Day Sensor Assembly (DSA) and associated electronics. The objective is to modernize the entire DSA system to enhance performance and prevent obsolescence as well as to increase the Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensors' ability to fully accommodate future weapons.</text>
