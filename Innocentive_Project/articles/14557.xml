  <text>Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training, Liverpool, New York, is being awarded a $27,283,219 modification to previously awarded contract (N00024-13-C-6292) to exercise options for the production of seven TB-37 multi-function towed array (MFTA) production units, tow cables, electro-optical slip rings, drogues and shipping products, and the performance of engineering services. The TB-37 MFTA is the next generation passive and active sonar receiver. It affords several enhancements to the AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array System allowing greater coverage, increased capability and reliability, and reduced obsolescence. The TB-37 MFTA significantly contributes to the capability of surface ships to detect, localize and prosecute undersea threats, and is a critical sensor to a combat systems suite. This contract combines an effort for the U.S. (86 percent) and Japan (14 percent) under the Foreign Military Sales program. Work will be performed in Syracuse, New York (66 percent); Millersville, Maryland (33 percent); and Marion, Massachusetts (1 percent), and is expected to complete by February 2017. Fiscal 2015 other procurement (Navy), foreign military sales and fiscal 2015 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) contract funds in the amount of $24,161,366 will be obligated at time of award and will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year. The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
