  <text>Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, Fort Worth, Texas, is being awarded a $237,740,000 modification to the previously awarded fixed-price-incentive-fee (firm target) F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Low Rate Initial Production IV contract for changes to the configuration baseline hardware or software resulting from the JSF development effort. This modification increases the concurrency cap for the U.S. Marine Corps and United Kingdom short take-off vertical landing aircraft; Air Force and Netherlands conventional take-off and landing aircraft; and Navy carrier variant aircraft. The concurrency cap establishes the threshold at or under which the contractor is obligated to incorporate government-authorized changes. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
