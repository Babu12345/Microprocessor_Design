  <text>Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., Linthicum Heights, Md., has been awarded the fifth contract in a fair opportunity, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity program with a total program amount of $24,375,000 for research and development regarding automatic target recognition (ATR). The Compact ATR and Sustainable Environment (CASE) program addresses efficiency and sustainability concerns associated with the development, operation and maintenance of current non-cooperative ATR technology. Research is focused on reducing template/database dimensionality and cost for single and multi-phenomenology ATR, while maintaining target identification performance. CASE will develop and demonstrate the ability to add new target representations to ATR databases rapidly, including potentially on-the-fly target insertion. CASE will exploit opportunities for increased operational efficiency and robustness through missionization of ATRs. Technology developments will be demonstrated in both laboratory and field environments, including real time flight demonstrations. CASE will also explore the migration of compact ATRs to operational use. The Air Force Research Laboratory is the contracting activity (FA8650-14-D-1750).</text>
