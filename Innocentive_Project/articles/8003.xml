  <text>This initiative launched by the U.S. Defense Department has several purposes to recognize the varied sacrifices and triumphs of the Vietnam War. The goals encompass thanking and honoring Vietnam veterans including those held as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action; highlighting the service of the armed forces and other organizations and agencies who supported them; and paying tribute to contributions made on the homefront by the American people. In addition, organizers hope to draw attention to advances in technology, science and medicine because of research conducted during the conflict and to recognize the contributions and sacrifices of U.S. allies during the war.

The Defense Department plans to coordinate with federal agencies, veteran groups, local governments and nongovernment organizations for input on activities. Interested parties can visit the website or call 877-387-9951 for more information. 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
