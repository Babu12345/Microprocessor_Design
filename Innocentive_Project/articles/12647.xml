  <text>The U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration has issued a request for proposals to further develop “extreme scale” supercomputer technology under the FastForward program. Contracts will total about $100 million and the funding period will be from July 2014 to November 2016. Proposals are due May 9.
	FastForward 2 seeks proposals from any company interested in working on extreme scale node architectures or memory technologies. Companies currently funded under FastForward 1 may propose follow-on research, and new research proposals and new companies for this program also are encouraged.</text>
