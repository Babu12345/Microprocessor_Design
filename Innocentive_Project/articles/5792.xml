  <text>Wounded, ill and injured military members and their families are often in need of financial and medical resources as they recover. The National Resource Directory (NRD) home page provides information on and access to a range of medical and non-medical services and resources. The site offers links to affiliated programs such as the Wounded Warrior Resource Center, which offers information about local military facilities, health care services and benefits. Another asset is the Recovery Coordination Program designed to improve the care, management and transition assistance for wounded, sick and injured military personnel. Other services include information about benefits and compensation; education, training and employment; family and caregiver support; housing and transportation; and support resources.
