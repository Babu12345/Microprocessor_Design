  <text>Eurocopter has received a Â£5 million capital grant from the United Kingdom government for the purchase of six new police Eurocopter EC135 helicopters for air support, part of the first joint procurement by six U.K. police forces. The grant also will provide enhanced state-of-the-art mission equipment. Each helicopter will feature the latest Airborne Law Enforcement and Police Reconnaissance and Surveillance systems as well as interoperable communications means, including daylight and thermal imaging cameras, Nightsun search lights, video down-link system and Tetra radios, which will allow easy communication both with police on the ground and with the other emergency services.</text>
