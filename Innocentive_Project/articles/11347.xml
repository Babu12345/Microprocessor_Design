Data Link Solutions LLC, Wayne, N.J., is being awarded $33,368,569 for cost-plus-incentive-fee delivery order #0037 under a previously awarded multiple award contract to develop, design and implement four nets of concurrent multi-netting with concurrent contention receive (CMN-4) on the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) terminal configuration. ViaSat Inc., Carlsbad, Calif., is being awarded $19,487,844. MIDS JTRS is a pre-planned product improvement replacement transforming the MIDS low volume terminal into a four-channel, software communications architecture compliant joint tactical radio system terminal while maintaining current Link-16 and tactical air navigation capability. CMN-4 will significantly increase operational Link-16 networks capacities, improve network performance and provide more capable and flexible Link-16 network designs for the warfighter. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, Calif., is the contracting activity. </text>
