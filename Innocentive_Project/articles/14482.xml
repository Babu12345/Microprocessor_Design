  <text>NATO today initiated Dynamic Mongoose, this year’s biggest antisubmarine warfare exercises in the North Sea, with a focus on detecting and defending against submarines. Eleven nations, more than a dozen surface vessels and four submarines are participating in the annual Dynamic Mongoose exercise. 

The event, which is expected to last two weeks, will allow ships under NATO command to conduct a variety of antisubmarine warfare operations. The submarines will take turns trying to approach and target the ships undetected, simulating an attack.

“The presence of NATO in Norwegian waters will enhance interoperability and will allow NATO to familiarize with Norwegian waters,” Commodore Ole Morten Sandquist, commander of the Norwegian fleet, said in a written statement.

Submarines from Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States are taking part along with 13 surface ships from Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Two research vessels—one Norwegian and one NATO-owned—also are participating. Norway, as the host nation, is providing support from the Haakonsvern Naval Base and the Sola Air Base, both of which are located near Bergen. France and Germany also are providing maritime patrol aircraft for the exercise.</text>
