  <text>MicroPact Inc., Herndon, Virginia, is being awarded a $12,989,520 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the Naval Justice Information System (NJIS). The NJIS will provide enterprise support for the United States Navy and Marine Corps criminal justice community's case management and reporting requirements. The NJIS program will enable end-to-end case management and incident reporting capabilities for the law enforcement, investigations, command actions, corrections and judicial actions communities, with implementation and configuration of the program in a two-phase approach. This program includes the replacement and retirement of the Consolidated Law Enforcement Operations Center, Corrections Management Information and Case Management systems, as well as the migration of all legacy data from those systems into the NJIS database. The Space and Naval Warfare System Command, San Diego, California, awarded the contract on behalf of its organizational partner, the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (N00039-14-D-0004).</text>
