  <text>Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors, Manassas, Virginia, is being awarded an undefinitized, not-to-exceed $7,500,000 modification to previously awarded contract for the procurement of two integrated submarine imaging system augment low profile photonics masts. The integrated submarine imaging system provides mission critical, all weather, visual, and electronic search, digital image management, indication, warning, and platform architecture interface capabilities for attack submarine nuclear propulsion SSN 688 (Los Angeles-class), SSN 21 (Seawolf-class); submersible, ship, guided, nuclear Ohio-class; and SSN 774 (Virginia-class) submarines with potential for ship, submersible, ballistic, nuclear; and possibly others. The integrated submarine imaging system rolls-up existing components and near-term capabilities to provide a robust architecture for efficiently inserting future capabilities as they become available, including items leveraged from the Virginia-class photonics program. Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, DC, is the contracting activity.</text>
