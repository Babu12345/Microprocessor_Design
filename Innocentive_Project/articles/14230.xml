  <text>The Ricardo-AEA chemical risk practice, the National Chemical Emergency Centre (NCEC), has won a three year contract to provide the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence with emergency telephone advice and access to NCEC’s hazardous chemicals database, which contains information on close to 60,000 chemicals . Through its emergency telephone advice service, the NCEC will provide global comprehensive support, enabling the Ministry of Defence to appropriately respond to chemical emergencies such as a spill or exposure.
