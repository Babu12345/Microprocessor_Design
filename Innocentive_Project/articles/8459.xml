  <text>Sensor Technology Engineering Incorporated, Santa Barbara, California, is being awarded a nearly $11 million firm-fixed-price commercial contract for the procurement of linear radiation monitors (LRM) and handheld radiation monitors (HRM). The LRM is a unique item containing multiple gamma and neutron radiation detectors spaced at three-foot intervals. It allows the operators to search for radioactive materials over large areas, around vehicles and containers and in wells and tunnels. The LRM can also be coiled and used as a search backpack by a single operator. The HRM is a single gamma and single neutron radiation detector that can be worn on a person or strapped onto a weapon or other piece of equipment. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Division, Indian Head, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
