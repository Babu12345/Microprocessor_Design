Computer Sciences Corp., San Diego, Calif., is being awarded a $19,990,044 cost-plus-fixed-fee bridge contract for information technology services to support the technology services organizations (TSO) requirements and its role as an enterprise business systems integrator for the Marine Corps. Services required are in support of highly complex government designed and owned Marine Corps business systems that have no parallel in other sectors of the government or private industry. Software engineering design, programming, testing, and integration to be performed under this contract will involve tasking that is so integrally related that it requires personnel with highly developed experiences with the specific systems supported by the TSO. The TSO supports a number of business mission areas across the Marine Corps, including the deputy commandant program and resources, deputy commandant manpower and reserve affairs, and the deputy commandant installation and logistics. The Regional Contracting Office, National Capital Region, Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Va., is the contracting activity. </text>
