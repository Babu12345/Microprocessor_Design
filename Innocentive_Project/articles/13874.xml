  <text>The U.S. secretary of defense recently approved a Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) concept and Joint Force Headquarters DODIN Operations within the U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) headed by the director of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). The new organization falls under CYBERCOM, but it is headed by Lt. Gen. Ronnie D. Hawkins Jr., USAF, DISAâ€™s director.

Lt. Gen. James McLaughlin, USAF, deputy commander, U.S. Cyber Command, explained this construct to the breakfast audience during the second day of TechNet Asia-Pacific 2014, being held December 9-11 in Honolulu. It represents a shift in focus for cybersecurity.

Gen. McLaughlin pointed out that Gen. Hawkins has been given directive authority over the entire organization. His authority extends over all of DODIN for operations guidance and defense. He has the ability to issue orders to anyone in the DODIN, including elements such as the services.
