  <text>An agreement between the two largest civilian employers in the U.S. Defense Department expands hiring programs for disabled veterans. The U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) and the Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) signed a memorandum of understanding to combine their existing wounded warrior programs: Always a Soldier and the Wounded Warrior Program, respectively. Under the agreement, the commands will jointly set and monitor wounded warrior hiring and lead management of the programs. The commands' combined resources will go toward establishing education and employment centers for veterans and their families and creating new lines of communication about employment opportunities. Disabled veterans can submit their information into a shared database and have access to opportunities anywhere AMC and NAVSEA have a presence.</text>
