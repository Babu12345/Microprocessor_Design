  <text>Helyx SIS Limited has been selected by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence to help define requirements for, and support delivery of the Future Deployable Geospatial Intelligence (FDG) capability. The Future Deployable Geospatial Intelligence Capability will provide an underpinning component of Network Enabled Capacity, supporting shared situational awareness and the decision support process. The aim of the project is to rationalize and upgrade the current geospatial intelligence capability to meet the projected range of military activities and intelligence requirements, including its closer integration into the wider defence intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance infrastructure. The project will provide enhanced geospatial intelligence capability to support operations in the land, air and maritime domains.</text>
