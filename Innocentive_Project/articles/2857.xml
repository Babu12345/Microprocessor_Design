  <text>To help prepare for upcoming AFCEA conferences, SIGNAL Media now offers a single e-place to find event details, ongoing news coverage, social media feeds and local area attractions. The aggregated event coverage features real- and near-real-time reports about speaker and panel content. A flickr feed will be updated regularly with photos taken of featured military and government leaders, panel discussions and the exhibition floor. To put the news coverage in perspective, the site also features links to articles published in SIGNAL Magazine that relate to the topics being discussed at the event. A live Twitter feed enables attendees and those interested in the event to comment that are displayed as they are tweeted.This newest member of the SIGNAL Media family debuts with coverage of the AFCEA WEST 2012 conference, which takes place at the San Diego Convention Center January 24 to 26.</text>
