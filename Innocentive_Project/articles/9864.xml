  <abstract>Military families can use Sittercity for free to find childcare. </abstract>
  <text>Summertime is prime PCS time, and as military families across the country relocate, the Defense Department is hoping to ease at least one common burden-finding child care providers. The department has funded free memberships to Sittercity so troops can find the right people to watch their children, whether they are moving to a new post or are requiring services at a current one. After filling out the fields necessary to create an account, applicants will be asked to provide certain pieces of information verifying eligibility.

Military child care providers also can join for free to make it easier for potential customers to find them.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
