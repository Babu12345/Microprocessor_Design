  <text>'Tis the season for giving, and nothing marks the start of the holiday season like the sight of Salvation Army volunteers collecting funds in red kettles. And now, fundraising for the Salvation Army has never been easier. The free Online Red Kettle app for iPhone lets you take on your own mobile campaign and collect donations with the click of a button. The convenient fundraising tool transforms app users into "virtual bell ringers." Use the tool to make updates to your personal fundraising page; track fundraising progress with a customized red kettle donation meter; upload photos to your personal page; and send appeals to friends and family to contribute. In addition, you can stay current on all Salvation Army news. The app, developed by Charity Dynamics Incorporated, is available for download in the iTunes App Store.
