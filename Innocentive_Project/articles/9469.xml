  <text>General Dynamics C4 Systems recently received a contract from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to deliver radios that allow air traffic control personnel to communicate with commercial and military aircraft throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). The 10-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract has a potential value of $363 million if all options are exercised. The contract is part of the FAA's Next Generation Air-Ground Communications (NEXCOM) Segment 2 program which includes replacing outmoded air traffic control (ATC) air-to-ground radios with radios using the latest in communications technology. The software-defined CM300/350 VHF and UHF air traffic control radios will provide Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capabilities along with improved ground-to-air communications performance.</text>
