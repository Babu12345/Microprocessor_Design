Under a newly exercised option for the AN/SLQ- 25C system contract, Boeing subsidiary Argon ST, Fairfax, Va., will continue to supply U.S. Navy surface ships with countermeasures that lure torpedoes away by mimicking a vessel’s propulsion system. The $8 million option covers production and delivery of eight new AN/SLQ-25C systems—commonly called Nixie—under the Navy’s Surface Ship Torpedo Defense program. An electro-acoustic towed decoy system, Nixie can communicate with its host ship’s network for a fully integrated defense capability.</text>
