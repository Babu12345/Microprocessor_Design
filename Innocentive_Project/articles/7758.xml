  <text>The Google Goggles app identifies real-world objects using a smart phone's camera, but that's not all. With the latest update, the program can even solve your Sudoku puzzle. The image-based search app is available on the Android platform and the Google for iPhone app. You simply snap a photo on your smart phone and instantly identify text, landmarks, books, contact information, artwork, wine and logos. With the latest update, the app provides faster barcode identification and the ability to recognize print ads. Just point your phone at an ad in a major U.S. magazine or newspaper and receive results on the products advertised. According to Google, the program can even solve your Sunday morning Sudoku:

	Our favorite weekend distraction is a quiet 15 minutes spent solving a Sudoku puzzle. But even that can be a frustrating experience if (like us) you make a mistake and are unable to solve the puzzle. Now, Goggles on Android and iPhone can recognize puzzles and provide answers to help make you faster than a Sudoku champ. So if you ever get stuck, take a clear picture of the entire puzzle with Goggles and we'll tell you the correct solution.
