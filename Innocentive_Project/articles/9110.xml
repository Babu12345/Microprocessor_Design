  <text>Get a new perspective on the world with the Layar app for iPhone and Android that displays real-time information over top of the image on your phone's camera. The free app uses your GPS location and augmented reality technology to discover information about the world around you and present it in "layers" on your smartphone. Choose from a catalog of more than 3,000 layers and experience the world in a new way. For example, if you're traveling to a country on business and looking for a restaurant, open the "Eat" layer and point the phone camera at the street in front of you. Various restaurant names and locations will pop up over the image. You can even see reviews in another layer. From retail shops to real estate information and more, the layers explore the world around you in real time. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store or the Android Market.
