  <text>What if your smartphone messages could self-destruct to ensure ultimate privacy and control over the content? No, it's not a scene from a spy movie. The newly released Wickr app for iPhone encrypts communication and permanently deletes personal data from your device. The free app provides military-grade encryption of text, picture, audio and video messages, and it gives the sender control over who can read messages and for how long. For example, a user could send a picture message but set it to self-destruct after 10 minutes. In addition, Wickr deletes all metadata from files. Currently, deleted data can still reside on the smartphone's internal memory, and this information is not secure. With the app's technology, messages cannot be recovered. Read the Wickr privacy policy for more information on the program's security. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store. The Android version is coming soon.
