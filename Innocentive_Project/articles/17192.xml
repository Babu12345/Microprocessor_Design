  <text>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate has announced an opportunity for manufacturers of Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment used in critical infrastructure to test their products against GPS jamming and spoofing.

The GPS Testing for Critical Infrastructure (GET-CI) event, to be held April 17-21, at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center in Butlerville, Indiana, is the first in a series of test opportunities.

DHS established the program to assess GPS vulnerabilities, advance research and development and to enhance outreach and engagement with industry, Robert Griffin, acting DHS under secretary for science and technology, said in a written announcement.Â The objective is to improve the security and resiliency of critical infrastructure, he added.

The GET-CI events provide industry an opportunity to test GPS equipment in unique live-sky environments. For the April 2017 GET-CI event, DHS will create live-sky test scenarios focused on spoofed GPS signals.

DHS invites manufacturers of commercial GPS receivers and equipment used in critical infrastructure to submit applications for participation. Submission instructions and further information are included in the Request for Information for Participation (RFIP) announcement on FedBizOpps. Interested organizations should submit applications for participation by March 33, 2017.
