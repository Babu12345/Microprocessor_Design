  <text>Looking for a way to spread holiday cheer? With the Donation Connection app for iPhone, giving back to your favorite charity is only a tap away. The program, developed by Rosetta Mobile, generates a list of all participating charities right on your mobile phone. Simply download the app, scroll through the list and tap your choice to donate. Whatever dollar amount you choose will be charged directly to your wireless bill or deducted from your prepaid balance. In addition, you can spread the word about your favorite cause using links to Facebook and Twitter. One tap can change the world. Download the free app from the iTunes App Store.
