This modification provides for the design, development and implementation of the airborne electronic attack requirements for software configuration set upgrades to software and ancillary hardware in support of the EA-18G aircraft for the Navy and the government of Australia. Work will be performed in Pt. Mugu, California, and is expected to be completed in July 2019. Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds in the amount of $1,305,889 are being obligated at time of award, none of which will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract combines purchases for the Navy ($83,752,197; 92 percent); and the government of Australia ($7,282,800; 8 percent) under the Foreign Military Sales program. The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, California, is the contracting activity.</text>
