  <text>An initiative of Microsoft, Elevate America Veterans helps former troops and their spouses acquire the skills and resources necessary for success in the workplace. The effort brings together public, private and nonprofit organizations interested in contributing their expertise, cash or other assets. In August, Microsoft partnered with the U.S. Department of Labor to expand the program and distribute 10,000 training and certification packages to veterans over a two-year period. These packages focus on building skills and familiarity with Microsoft software; they will be available in the coming weeks through the department's One-Stop Career centers.

Microsoft also continues to recruit through its Military 2 Microsoft program, which helps veterans and those serving in the Reserve or National Guard to transition into the civilian work force by finding job opportunities within the company.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
