  <text>The U.S. Veterans Affairs Department (VA) has put 20 extra Mobile Vet Centers on the road to increase access to readjustment counseling services for veterans and their family members living in rural or underserved communities. Each vehicle serves as an office on wheels with space dedicated to confidential counseling and a high-tech communications package. These mobile centers also can provide emergency support for national disasters and will be located across the country.

The 20 new vehicles-which the VA says are American made-join a fleet of 50 already existing Mobile Vet Centers along with 300 permanent Vet Centers. The VA also has plans to add 230 emergency shuttle vehicles to its fleet during the next five years. They will provide routine transportation for veterans seeking medical care in and around various metropolitan areas. In the event of a disaster or emergency, the shuttles can double as mobile clinics to evacuate patients and their care teams.

A list of Mobile Vet Center locations is available on the VA website.  To find a Vet Center in your area, visit www.vetcenter.va.gov.

 

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
