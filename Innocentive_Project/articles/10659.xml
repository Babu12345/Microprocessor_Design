Computer Sciences Corp., San Diego, Calif., is being awarded a potential $9,437,767 modification to previously awarded indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to exercise an option to provide engineering services for network and information systems that are currently operational and/or under development. Exercising of this award-term option will bring the total contract value to $35,659,074. This is one of two multiple award contracts: both awardees compete for task orders during the ordering period.
