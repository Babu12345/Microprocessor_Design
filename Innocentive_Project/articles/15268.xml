  <text>Infoscitex Corp., Littleton, Massachusetts, has been awarded a $24,500,000 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the development of fundamental research tools in the areas of sensor exploitation, algorithm performance understanding and performance prediction. Contractor will provide established, enhanced and clarified sensor exploitation performance benchmarks, which will serve both to focus technology development on relevant problems and filter out immature technologies not ready for transition. Work will be performed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and is expected to be completed by September 27, 2022. This award is the result of a competitive acquisition, and three offers were received. Fiscal 2015 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $1,442,000 are being obligated at the time of award. Air Force Research Lab, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity (FA8650-15-D-1950).
