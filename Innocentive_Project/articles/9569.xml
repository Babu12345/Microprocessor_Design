  <text>The homeland is now part of the battlespace as the pace of change is increasing, according to a member of the Joint Staff. Lt. Gen. George J. Flynn, USMC, director, J-7, the Joint Staff, told the audience at Joint Warfighting 2012 in Virginia Beach that adversaries are taking advantage of change, and that trend is likely to increase in the near future. "If you like the complexity and uncertainty of today, you're really going to like tomorrow," Gen. Flynn said. He noted that the terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks exploited inexpensive and commonly available assets to plan and execute their onslaughts. They conducted their mission planning using Google Earth, and they used conventional cell networks to carry out their command and control. When a tourist snapped and posted on the Web a cell phone photo of Indian Army commandos dropping on the roof of the hotel, the terrorists used it to lay a trap to ambush the would-be rescuers. This was accomplished without any investment in expensive technologies or systems, the general observed. This democratization of technology is closing the gap between the West and its enemies, he continued. The battlespace of the past was linear with clear definitions. The future battlespace is multidimensional with several domains.</text>
