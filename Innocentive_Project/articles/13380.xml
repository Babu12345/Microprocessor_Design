  <text>The release of new high-quality positional information on space debris of unknown origin will help satellite owner-operators better protect their space assets. The U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) now can run a program that shows where space objects are and where they will be, as well as the potential for these objects colliding. This information has been added to Space-Track.org.
	According to the Joint Functional Component Command (JFCC) for Space, Vandenberg Air Force Base, more than 17,000 space objects are being tracked on a continuous basis. An estimated 1,100 of these are active satellites currently conducting operations; however, that number does not include the approximately 16,000 objects in space that are not active and/or of unknown origin and concern the JFCC and STRATCOM the most.
	STRATCOM has been sharing space situational awareness information on the Space-Track website for several years. The command provides tailored information and services to owners and operators through sharing agreements to maximize spaceflight safety and the long-term sustainability of space.Â </text>
