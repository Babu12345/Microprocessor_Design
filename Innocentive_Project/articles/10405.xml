  <text>Christmas is almost upon us, and anyone who wants do some extra good with their last-minute spending should check out the USO Wishbook. This alternative giving catalogue enables people to give a gift to someone they know while benefitting the military community. In essence, instead of presenting a material gift directly to a loved one, givers send comforting items to troops, their families or wounded warriors on behalf of that person. After making their purchases, buyers can send e-cards to the original gift recipients (not the military-community members) to let them know about the present bestowed in their honor.
	Givers can search for gifts based on interest, price or recipient to find the perfect option. Groups or organizations may want to choose one of the expensive items such as building a bike for a wounded warrior or sponsoring an airdrop.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNALâ€™s news editor.</text>
