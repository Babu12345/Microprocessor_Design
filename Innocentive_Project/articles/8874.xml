  <text>The Pentagon's TRICARE office is offering assistance to nearly 5 million people who may have been affected by a recent data breach contractor Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) reported. Officials say the breach came to light in Texas in mid-September and involves patients treated at military hospitals and clinics during the past 20 years. The data, stored on magnetic tapes stolen from a car, includes names, Social Security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers, along with clinic notes, lab tests and prescription information. The TRICARE Management Activity has directed SAIC to provide a year of free credit monitoring and restoration services to those affected by the breach. For more information, call the SAIC Incident Response Call Center. Â </text>
