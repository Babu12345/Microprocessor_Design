  <text>A free travel app for iPhone lets you locate Wi-Fi in more than 465,000 locations in 140 countries worldwide. The Wi-Fi Finder app from JiWire Incorporated can find free or paid Wi-Fi so you can stay connected on the road. Using the Global Positioning System function on your iPhone or iPod Touch, the finder will tell you where the closest Wi-Fi hotspot is and how to get there. You can narrow down the Wi-Fi locations by provider, such as Comcast, or by location type. Choose between restaurants, hotels and more and receive a phone number and directions to the area. The current version is available for free in the iTunes App Store, and it has a four-star rating from more than 220 reviews.
