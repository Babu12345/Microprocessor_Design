Fiscal 2015 operations and maintenance (Navy) funding in the amount of $230,000 will be obligated at time of award, and will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was not competitively procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, Newport, Rhode Island, is the contracting activity (N66604-15-D-0132).</text>
