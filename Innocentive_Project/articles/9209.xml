  <text>ITT Corporation, Clifton, New Jersey, is being awarded a $19,636,772 cost-plus-fixed-fee delivery order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement for the design, development, integration, test, and delivery of software and firmware improvements to the existing ALQ-214(V)4/5 Jammer System. This software improvement program is intended to modify ALQ-214(V)4/5 software and firmware with additional electronic countermeasure functionality to meet emerging threat scenario requirements; update current jamming technique functionality; and improve wingman compatibility by implementing digital signal processing techniques for better pulse signature measurements by the AN/ALQ-214(V)4/5 for F/A-18 C/D/E/F. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
