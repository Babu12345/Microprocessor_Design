  <text>The Operation American Dream contest sponsored by Signal 88 Security is taking a veteran “From Battlefield to Boss” by offering start-up money for an entrepreneurial venture. Each month through May 15, eligible veterans can submit a 500-word essay on why they deserve to be their own boss. Three monthly finalists will be selected by Signal 88 Security and the winner will be determined by a public vote. Those winners receive $500 and are eligible for the Grand Prize of $5,000. If the winner decides to open a Signal 88 Security franchise with the winnings, the company will increase the amount to $10,000.
	Essays are due by January 15 for the first round of the contest. More complete information is available on the website.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s news editor.
