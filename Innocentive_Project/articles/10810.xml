  <text>Cobham, Wimborne, United Kingdom, has been awarded a Â£16 million ($24 million) order to supply NATO forces with leading-edge vehicle mounted Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detection equipment. These systems will be delivered in 2013 by Cobham Antenna Systems. Cobham will deliver enhanced counter-IED detection capabilities, which can be safely deployed from within the protection of mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles.</text>
