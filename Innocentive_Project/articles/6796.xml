  <text>The U.S. Navy has awarded the Boeing Company an $11.4 million contract to supply Laser Joint Direct Attack Munitions (Laser JDAM) to meet the Navy's Direct Attack Moving Target Capability (DAMTC) requirement. The initial contract calls for the delivery of 23 munitions for testing and evaluation and is expected to lead to a production contract in 2011. With follow-on options, total DAMTC deliveries could reach 11,000 units and the total contract value could exceed $91 million.</text>
