  <text>February may seem far away, but it will be here in no time at all. Make plans now to attend two great events: the West 2010 Conference in San Diego and the Homeland Security Conference in Washington, D.C.

The West Conference is February 2-4. The theme is "Smart Power: Does the QDR Get It Right?" Speakers include Gen. Cartwright, Adm. Roughead and Adm. Stavridis. I have been fortunate to hear Adm. Stavridis speak before, and he is an excellent, engaging presenter. The conference is going to be exciting, and I encourage everyone to attend. More information about West is available online.

Also in February is the Homeland Security Conference, held February 24-25. The theme is "DHS--The 7-Year Itch: Renewing the Commitment." This is a great opportunity to hear people engage on hot-button topics such as cybersecurity, identity management, transparency, and information and intelligence sharing.
