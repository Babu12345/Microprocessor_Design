  <text>Northrop Grumman Corporation's Sperry Marine business unit, Charlottesville, Virginia, has won a contract to upgrade the navigation radars on five Swedish navy patrol boats. Under the contract, Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine will retrofit each ship with two dual-band interswitched chart radar systems with navalized display features. The systems are based on Sperry Marine's advanced VisionMaster FT navigation technology with WideView multifunction displays. The initial contract includes five ships with options for six additional ships, plus a spare system, spare parts, service and maintenance. CA Clase Marinelektronik AB, Sperry Marine's sales and service representative in Sweden, will be responsible for installing, commissioning, testing and technical support for the project.</text>
