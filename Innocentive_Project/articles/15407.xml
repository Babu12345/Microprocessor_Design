  <text>The Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) will host an Industry Day to engage with businesses on opportunities associated with the recompete of its Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN) contract. 

The NGEN provides network-centric data and services to U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel and is the follow-on effort to provide enterprise network services consolidated in 2000 under the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) contract. It is the governmentâ€™s largest information technology outsourcing program. 

The two-year-old NGEN acquisition approach is up for a recompete contract battle. The solution divides services into segments, a move that lets the Navy allow competition for each portion as needed and promotes greater competition within industry. 

Navy officials will gather input from businesses to then determine an acquisition approach for potential NGEN follow-on contracts and other opportunities. 

The Industry Day will be held November 17 in Virginia. Additional information, including the agenda and how to register, can be found on FedBizOpps.gov. Attendees may also register via e-mail. ?

There is no fee to attend Industry Day activities.</text>
