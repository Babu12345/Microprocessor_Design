  <text>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, is being awarded a $13,536,712 task order under an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract to utilize the Comprehensive National Incident Management System. The objective of this research and development effort is to provide high-performance computing methods for modeling very large socio-technical, biological, and information systems. These will be in the areas of surveillance and sensing integration; simulation-based course-of-action analysis and decision support; "simfrastructure" specialization and enhancement; infectious disease assessment capability enhancement; and large-scale network efforts. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, is the contracting activity.</text>
