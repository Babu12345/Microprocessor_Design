  <text>The Joint Information Environment (JIE) will be relying on virtual capabilities to a greater degree as part of several thrusts within the network. Enabling technologies include the cloud and software modernization as planners strive to ensure interoperability and access wherever users may be located.
	The issue was raised during the opening panel on the final day of AFCEA’s three-day JIE Mission Partner Symposium being held in Baltimore May 12-14. David Bennett, chief information officer, Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), explained that the commercial cloud offers the ability to host a variety of capabilities at low cost and with minimum vulnerability. Even sensitive but unclassified material may be located in the commercial cloud, he stated.
	Bennett told of “a huge effort to virtualize capabilities,” and DISA wants users to understand their migration to the virtual world in the data center. This migration will help in moving toward the next generation of capabilities, he added, noting that this effort is long overdue.
	“We still have quite a few Cobols out there,” he pointed out.</text>
