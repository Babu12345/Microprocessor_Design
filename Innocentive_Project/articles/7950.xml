  <text>Hydroid Incorporated, Pocasset, Massachusetts, was recently awarded a $17 million contract modification to provide service for the currently fielded legacy Small Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (SUUV) systems and to provide continued depot level and engineering support for the SUUV program. The SUUV program provides explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) forces with a very shallow water mine countermeasures and underwater object location system. Hydroid will provide expert technical and engineering support services to maintain the full functionality of fielded systems as well as provide additional systems that may be required by the EOD community to meet mission requirements.Â The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head, Maryland, is the contracting activity.</text>
