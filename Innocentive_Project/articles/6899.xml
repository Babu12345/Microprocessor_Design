  <text>The U.S. Government's per diem rate determines how business expenses can be reimbursed for government employees and many other business travelers as well. But rates vary from city to city, and country to country, especially in metropolitan areas, and if you're anything like me, you have to look up the mileage reimbursement rate every single time you need it. The PerDiem app, which works with iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches, takes all that information and integrates it with the GPS/Location Services function of the device to make finding per diem-friendly establishments easier. It also includes a mileage calculatorÂ  and an overall trip calculator. Limitations noted by reviewers on the App Store include not being able to save favorite locations and a lack of military installations. Annual updates to reflect fiscal year requirements are also necessary. But for 99 cents, it can be very helpful on the go. PerDiem is available from the iTunes Store.
