  <text>Northrop Grumman, Linthicum Heights, Maryland, is being awarded a $33,158,857 modification to a cost plus fixed fee contract. The Advanced Rotary Wing Multifunction Sensor (ARMS), Multifunction RF program Phase II, will be the detailed design/build phase which aims for a tower demonstration of a controlled flight into terrain sensor and a multifunction sensor suite, and support of integration of radar data into the synthetic vision avionics backbone. This phase seeks to provide the detailed design of the multiple sub-array aperture based on the concepts developed in Phase 1. This phase will be accomplished by using the extensive set of existing Northrop Grumman RF design and aperture design infrastructure, as has been previously applied in the development of active electronically scanned array products for previous programs. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is the contracting activity.</text>
