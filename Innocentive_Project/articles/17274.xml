  <text>Hadal Inc., Oakland, California, is being awarded a $14,171,492 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for the science and technology research of the Office of Naval Research Large Displacement Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Innovative Naval Prototypes program. This contract contains options that, if exercised, will bring the total cumulative value to $39,068,913. Work will be performed in Oakland and is expected to be completed by February 28, 2021. If all options are exercised, the work will continue through February 28, 2022. Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $50,000 will be obligated at the time of award. No funds will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was competitively procured under Office of Naval Research broad agency announcement (BAA) N00014-17-S-B001. Because proposals will be received throughout the year under the long-range BAA, the number of proposals received in response to the solicitation is unknown.
