  <text>Northrop Grumman Mission Systems, Clearfield, Utah, is being awarded an approximate $11 million contract modification to design and test weapon system processor (WSP) hardware and software changes that preclude generation of a continuous signal on the command transmit lines. The company also will design and develope material change to the WSP to ensure circuit cards are correctly installed and remain fully seated during transportation and when installed in the Launch Control Center operational and training environment. The U.S. Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, is the contracting activity.</text>
