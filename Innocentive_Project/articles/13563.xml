TIH is the latest generation of display, processor, and network requirements for combat control and sonar systems for U.S. Navy submarines. Equipment will provide modernization and upgrade of systems currently installed on SSN 688i, SSBN, SSGN, Seawolf, Virginia class, and Ohio Replacement submarines, as well as installation of initial systems for new construction Virginia class submarines. This contract includes an option, which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of the contract to an estimated $384,340,759. The option combines purchases for the U.S. Navy (94.2 percent), and the government of Australia (5.8 percent), under the Foreign Military Sales program. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, Keyport, Washington, is the contracting activity (N00253-14-D-0004).</text>
