  <text>ThalesRaytheonSystems has signed a memorandum of understanding to supply 20 Ground Master 400 (GM400) long-range air defense radars to the Kazakh air force. The agreement provides for the development of GM400 radars for the Kazakh air force by Granit Thales Electronics, a joint venture formed by Thales and SKTB Granit in 2012 under a defense-industry partnership. This radar is designed for both fixed-site operation under a radome and for operations in the field, where it can be deployed in under two hours. The GM400s will boost Kazakhstanâ€™s air defense capabilities, giving the Kazakh Air Force the ability to detect a broad array of threats from low to high altitude, assuring extended air surveillance over its territory.</text>
