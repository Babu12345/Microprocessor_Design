  <text>Cobham has reached agreement with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to extend the existing Sentinel aerial maritime surveillance contract by 2 years, the company recently announced. This £105 million ($22,580,000) contract extension secures the contract until the end of 2021. Cobham Aviation Services has been protecting Australia’s borders since 1995 under a performance based service contract involving the full turnkey operation of 10 highly modified Bombardier Dash 8 maritime patrol aircraft that fly 2,500 missions and 15,000 hours each year.
