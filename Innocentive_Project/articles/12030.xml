  <text>The U.S. Pacific Air Forces will benefit greatly from combining its A-3 and A-6, said its director of communications and chief information officer. Col. Michael Finn II, USAF, told the audience at the opening panel discussion at TechNet Asia-Pacific 2013 in Honolulu, Hawaii, that the Pacific Air Forces would have “a lot of synergy combining the -3 with the -6.”
	The concept of cyber readiness has a different perspective from the operations side and the cyber side. This consolidation helps provide warfighting integration across the entire network, Col. Finn said.
	“We need to apply some cyber common sense to all of our cyber elements—not just the NIPRNET [nonsecure Internet protocol router network] and SIPRNET [secret Internet protocol router network],” he stated.
	Combining the two elements will not eliminate specialties. “You’ll see a flying deputy and a cyber deputy,” the colonel offered.
