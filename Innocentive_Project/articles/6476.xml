  <text>I spend every summer eagerly awaiting the approach of fall for one reason: Starbucks' pumpkin spice latte. (Then I anticipate the holiday season for the gingerbread latte.) Thanks to iCoffee, addicts like me can keep track of how much money they spend on these delicious treasures. The app also features full Starbucks menus, information about local stores, nutrition facts and more. It's available for iPhone at Apple.com. What app can't you live without?
