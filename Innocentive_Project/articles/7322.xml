  <text>The U.S. Defense Department is resuming the military spouse career advancement accounts program (MyCAA) after a comprehensive review and restructuring. The benefits will be available for spouses of service members in ranks E1 to E5, W1 to W2 and O1 to O2 beginning on October 25. Eligible spouses will receive a total of $4,000 in department-funded financial aid, with an annual fiscal year limit of $2,000. Funding must be used to obtain an associate's degree, licensure or certification within three years of the start date of the first class. When license or certificate programs demand an up-front fee greater than the $2,000 limit, a waiver may be granted for funding up to the $4,000 limit. MyCAA participants will receive broader support as well. Under the long-term guidelines for the program, career counselors will work with military spouses to develop career and education goals and plans and to assist them in finding and accessing other federal benefits. Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information.</text>
