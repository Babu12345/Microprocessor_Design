  <text>Raytheon Network Centric Systems, St. Petersburg, Florida, is being awarded a $67,407,373 modification to previously awarded contract for design agent and engineering support services in support of the Cooperative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) Program. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. This contract action combines purchases for the U.S. Navy, and the government of Australia under the Foreign Military Sales Program.  The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C., is the contracting activity.</text>
