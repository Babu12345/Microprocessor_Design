Torch lets you keep in touch with customers, coworkers and suppliers with one easy tool. You can attach messages, files, Google Docs, invoices and more to your projects. You can also track time and expenses, bill clients, and import data. There are two versions: the full-powered one and a faster offline version. To learn more, visit the Web site.
