  <abstract>Somebody help me, please.  I need either therapy or a definitional explanation, or both.

Why do I get roused every time I see a small business with the man or woman at the top titled "chairman"?  Isn’t the term used for publically held companies where there is stock, a full sized board of directors and divisions, etc. rather than small, privately held LLCs and sole proprietor entities?

And the same goes for the title of ‘chief executive officer’.  Doesn’t this imply a person is Chief among a cadre of sector VPs, regional officers and other managers who can commit an organization?

This may be peevish on my part, but I don’t care for titles that inflate one’s size or importance.  And I’m thinking there are many titles out there that attempt to do so.

Can anyone help me with this?
