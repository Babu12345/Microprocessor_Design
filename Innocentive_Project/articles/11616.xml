  <text>Are you a cycling enthusiast? Whether you compete in races or just peddle around the neighborhood with your family, the MapMyRide app will help you make the most of your cycling experience.
	The free app turns your smartphone into a cycling computer, using the built-in GPS to track your fitness activities. It records your ride details, including speed, distance, calories burned, elevation and the route traveled on an interactive map. Voice prompts can update you on your progress as you go. Feeling competitive? Compete against results from other riders on popular rides in your area. You can even post your workouts to Facebook and Twitter.
	Download the app from the iTunes App Store or Google Play.
	Several cyclists from AFCEA International headquarters currently are using the app to prepare for the upcoming AFCEA Cycle for STEM event. On Monday, October 7, a team of 20 cyclists will leave Pittsburgh to begin a six day, 335 mile ride to Washington, D.C., to raise funds for AFCEA science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) educational programs. Visit the website to learn how to become a sponsor of this event, or email Sean McGowan and Terry Rogers to learn more about joining the team or volunteering.The MapMyRide app sites are not affiliated with AFCEA or SIGNAL Magazine, and we are not responsible for the content or quality of the products offered.
