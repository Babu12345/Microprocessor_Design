  <text>Harris Corporation recently received a $14 million contract from the State of Vermont to deploy a statewide radio system for public safety first responders and state agencies. The system meets Vermont's specific requirements for regional and cross-border communications - connecting local, state and federal agencies within the state, and providing interoperability with agencies in neighboring states and Canada. The Project 25 standards-based system will be built on Harris Voice, Interoperability, Data, Access network technology, an Internet Protocol-based interoperable radio communications technology that fully complies with emerging standards.</text>
