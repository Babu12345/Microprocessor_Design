  <text>Northrop Grumman System Corporation, Defense Systems Division, Herndon, Virginia, is being awarded about $18 million for the purchase of Global Express aircraft BD-700-1A10, serial number 9001, and the two engines currently installed on the aircraft. This aircraft has been modified to carry the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload. The aircraft and engines are provided by Northrop Grumman under sub-lease in support of overseas contingency operations under contract. This contract also provides for the operation and maintenance of the BACN payload by Northrop Grumman and for the maintenance of the leased aircraft. Purchase of this aircraft by the government will allow for extension of operations on a more economic basis. Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, is the contracting activity.</text>
