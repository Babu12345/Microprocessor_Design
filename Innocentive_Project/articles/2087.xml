  <abstract>There is plenty of reason for excitement and hope, if you are focused on the federal market.  But this certainly does not mean it's easy to hit your revenue targets.  The key, as with any sales effort, is this: change means opportunity.  There is plenty of change going on across the federal organizations, especially the military and the IC agencies.  So, if you have not studied the federal landscape since the new Administration moved into the White House, this is a great time to do so.  Your task as a small business owner (or executive) is to clearly map your unique offering to those changes, and then be the best you can be at delivering it.  </abstract>
