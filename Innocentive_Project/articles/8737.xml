  <text>The Code of Support Foundation has created a code that transitions the phrase "support our troops" into meaningful promises that actually benefit troops, veterans and their families. Citizens can read the pledge online and then electronically sign it to become part of the Corps of Support, a dispersed group of people who take action to help the military community. The website features a list of organizations endorsed by the foundation. Signers are encouraged to volunteer at them or to donate money. Endorsements are based on organizations' missions as well as the quality of their operations and the results they achieve. The list is broken down into four categories. The foundation also hosts various events that promote its message throughout the year.

Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL's news editor.</text>
