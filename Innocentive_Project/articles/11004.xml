  <text>An empty seat at a big production does no one any good. So, the Veteran Tickets Foundation provides free or discounted tickets for all sorts of shows and events to members of the military community. Organization personnel work with leagues, groups and venues to obtain the passes and also accept donations of tickets or funds from the general public. The military community can check out the Events section to find out which shows and games are or will be available. To request tickets, users must create an account with the website.
	Through the Hero’s Wish program, certain troops, veterans and families of service members killed in action can ask one time for specific tickets to a single event and donors will help to fulfill the request.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s senior news editor.</text>
