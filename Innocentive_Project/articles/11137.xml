  <text>Klein Tools will donate $25,000 in 2013 to Operation Homefront, an organization that provides emergency financial and other assistance to the families of U.S. service members and wounded warriors. The donations are planned to be outright and not connected to any sales or promotion, but Klein is giving its customers a chance to show their support for the military as well. And the opportunity comes with a fancy, exciting name.
	The company has introduced Limited Edition Camouflage 2000 Series High-Leverage Side-Cutting Pliers. To create the tools, Klein transformed the look of its most popular 2000 Series Side-Cutting Pliers with a plastic-dipped camouflage handle design and a black-oxide plier head with a laser-etched “Support Our Troops” logo. The items all will be manufactured in the United States.
	Anyone who wants to order a set should visit the company’s Distributor Locator to find a store that carries them, because the tools are not available online. So hurry on down for pliers full of pride, just don’t drop them in any wooded areas.Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s senior news editor.</text>
