  <text>Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Integrated Systems Sector, San Diego, California, is being awarded an approximate $22 million contract modification and a more than $13 million modification. The first is for: software maintenance, covering the tasks necessary for the contractor to maintain and support software for air vehicle, ground and support segments; and flight test, covering the tasks necessary for the Global Hawk (GH) system integrator (prime contractor) to participate in planning, provisioning, conducting, analyzing, and documenting an integrated GH Combined Development/Operational Flight Test Program. These tasks provide the software maintenance and flight test to keep the development program operating. The second if for the infrastructure portion of the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) block load effort, which provides for the necessary tasks that allow the contractor to manage the day-to-day EMD contract operations of the Global Hawk weapon system including air vehicle, ground segment, and support segment. These tasks provide the infrastructure necessary to keep the developmental program operational. They are not directly tied to any one specific developmental capability. Aeronautical Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, is the contracting activity</text>
