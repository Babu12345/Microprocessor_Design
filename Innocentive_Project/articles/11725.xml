  <text>Insitu Inc., Bingen, Wash., is being awarded $7,264,250 for firm-fixed-price delivery order #0016 against a previously issued basic ordering agreement (N00019-12-G-0008) for hardware repairs and modifications to previously procured ScanEagle Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) for the government of Poland under the foreign military sales program. This effort procures spares, operations and maintenance training, and technical UAS publications. The hardware includes air vehicles, their components, and improvements to the systems ancillary equipment, including ground control stations and launch and recovery equipment. The company also was awarded a $300 million firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contractÂ (N00019-13-D-0016) for hardware and operational and maintenance services in support of the ScanEagle Unmanned Aerial Systems operated by the U.S. Special Operations Command. The hardware and services to be provided include replacement air vehicles, spare and consumable parts, and in-theatre field service representatives to supplement naval special warfare operators. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Md., is the contracting activity for both awards.</text>
