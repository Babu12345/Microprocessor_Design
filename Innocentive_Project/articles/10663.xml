  <text>Anyone who follows Homefront Help, or veterans news in general, knows that finding meaningful employment for former service members is a serious concern. For that reason, the Code of Support Foundation and a variety of partners are featuring the Musical VETStravaganza on February 17 that salutes veterans and highlights the Hiring Our Heroes program. The show starts at 3 p.m. at George Washington University’s Lisner Auditorium. Performers include country music stars Mark Wills and David Kroll as well as the West Point Cadet Glee Club.
	The concert is free and open to the public, but tickets are required. They can be obtained online at www.lisner.org or by phone at 202-994-6851 and 202-994-9599.
	 
Homefront Help also has a Facebook page where visitors can gather and share information. If you know of a program that is helping service personnel, veterans or their families please submit that information to Rita Boland, SIGNAL’s news editor.</text>
