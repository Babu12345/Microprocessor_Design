  <text>Rugged MonitorsMonitoring visual data such as telemetry and video feeds under rugged conditions can be hard on both the equipment and users’ eyes. The RD2217 line features dual 17-inch SXGA monitors with an impact-resistant, laminated stack and scratch-resistant, low-reflectance cover glass. The monitors are designed to provide high contrast and low reflectance in bright environments. The dual displays and a small keyboard, trackball mouse and drop-down wrist rest are configured to lie flat for storage.
